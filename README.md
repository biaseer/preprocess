## Acknowledgment

### [The GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/)
**A Global Database of Society**. Supported by Google Jigsaw, the GDELT Project monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day, creating a free open platform for computing on the entire world.

We developed a semi-automated news text crawling framework based on the original raw data provided by GDELT and obtained the data (related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict) input required by [the Biaseer Prototype System](https://github.com/biaseer/Biaseer) after data cleaning and processing.
