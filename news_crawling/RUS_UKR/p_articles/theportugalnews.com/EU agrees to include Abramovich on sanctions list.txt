The decision, which forms part of the fourth package of EU sanctions against Moscow, announced last Friday by the European Commission, will have to be formally adopted, which should happen later today, and should include in the list of sanctions, 15 more individuals and nine entities, according to Lusa.
The inclusion of Abramovich in the list of natural and legal persons, coincides with the opening of an investigation in Portugal to prove whether there are irregularities in the granting Portuguese nationality to the Russian businessman, as he is a descendant of Sephardic Jews.
