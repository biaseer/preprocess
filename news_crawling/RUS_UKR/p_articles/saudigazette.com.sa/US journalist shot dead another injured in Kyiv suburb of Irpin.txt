In the Donetsk region, Mariupol remains under siege.The humanitarian crisis worsens as gas, water and electricity shortages continue to affect the residents of many cities, including the besieged southern port of Mariupol.Ukrainian authorities again accused Russia of violating the ceasefire agreement and opening fire on "humanitarian corridors". Just nine of 14 agreed-upon corridors were open on Saturday, with 13,000 people evacuated on them around the country.At least 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine in the two weeks since Russia invaded it, UNHCR said.Pope Francis, meanwhile, decried the barbarianism of killing children and other defenseless civilians in Ukraine and pleaded to stop the attacks before cities are reduced to cemeteries.In some of his most vigorous denunciations yet of the war in Ukraine, and in an apparent reference to Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the pontiff said that there are no strategic reasons that hold up in the face of such armed aggression.Francis told about 25,000 people gathered in St. Peters Square for his customary Sunday noon appearance that Mariupol, the southern Ukrainian city that bears the name of the Virgin Mary, has become a city martyred by the heartbreaking war that is devastating Ukraine.In the name of God, I ask: Stop this massacre, Francis said, sparking applause from the pilgrims, tourists and Romans, some of whom held Ukrainian flags, in the square.Francis prayed for an end to the bombings and other attacks and for ensuring that humanitarian corridors are safe and secure.Also the large military drone that crashed on the outskirts of the Croatian capital Zagreb on Thursday night had "airplane bomb" parts, Minister of Defense Mario Banoi said on Sunday."Traces of explosives were found, as well as other traces that indicate that this was not a scouting aircraft," he told the gathered press in Zagreb. "We found airplane bomb parts and have concluded that it was also Soviet-made."The 1970s-made missile-like drone Tu-141 is currently in use by Ukrainian forces, but Banoi said that the Russian military could have launched the aircraft."There are elements indicating it could have come from either side," he stated.A black box has been retrieved, and its contents are being analyzed. Banoi also stated that Croatia would work together with NATO  who are conducting a parallel investigation  to try and retrace the drone's point of origin.In another development, Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov has called on NATO to immediately implement a no-fly zone after a Russian missile attack on the Yavoriv training facility near Lviv in western Ukraine."Russia has attacked the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security near Lviv. Foreign instructors work here," Reznikov said on Twitter. "This is new terrorist attack on peace  security near the EU-NATO border. Action must be taken to stop this. Close the sky!"  Euronews
