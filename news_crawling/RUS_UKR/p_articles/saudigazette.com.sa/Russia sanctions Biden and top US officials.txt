MOSCOW  Russia has sanctioned US President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and several other administration officials in retaliation for US sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchs and commodities, according to Bloomberg News.The sanctions would prohibit travel and freeze any assets held in Russia but not prevent high-level talks if they are planned, Bloomberg reported.Russia also sanctioned Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, press secretary Jen Psaki, CIA Director William Burns and other economic and financial officials.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, were also included, but both do not currently serve in the US government.The sanctions, while largely symbolic and expected, still mark an escalation in hostilities between the US and Russia.
