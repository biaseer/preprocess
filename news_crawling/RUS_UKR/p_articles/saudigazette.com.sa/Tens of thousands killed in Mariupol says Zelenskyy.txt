The occupiers besieged it and did not even allow water and food to be brought there. The Russians completely destroyed Mariupol and reduced it to ashes. At least tens of thousands of citizens of Mariupol must have been killed," he said.The Ukrainian president accused Russia of wanting to make Mariupol "an example", calling on South Korea to help his country fight the Russian invasion by providing it with military equipment, "from planes to tanks".Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer will visit Moscow on Monday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the first EU leader to visit since the start of the war amid news that Russia has appointed a new Ukraine war commander, Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, a veteran of the Russian campaign in Syria.Austrias foreign minister said Chancellor Karl Nehammer is taking very clear messages of a humanitarian and political kind to a meeting with Putin in Moscow.Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said Monday that Nehammer decided to make the trip after meeting in Kiev on Saturday with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and following contacts with the leaders of Turkey, Germany and the European Union.Schallenberg said ahead of a meeting with his EU counterparts in Luxembourg that We dont want to leave any opportunity unused and must seize every chance to end the humanitarian hell in Ukraine.He added, Every voice that makes clear to President Putin what reality looks like outside the walls of Kremlin is not a wasted voice.Schallenberg said that Nehammer and Putin would meet one-on-one without media opportunities. He insisted that Austria has done everything to ensure that the visit isnt abused, and I think he Putin himself should have an interest in someone telling him the truth and really finding out whats going on outside."Britain's Ministry of Defense said Russia needs to boost troop numbers with extra recruitment, due to mounting losses in the war, while, European Union foreign ministers meeting to weigh the effectiveness of the blocs response to Russia's invasion.The Croatian Foreign Ministry said that 24 staff at the Russian embassy in Zagreb would be expelled from the country. The staff include 18 diplomats and 6 members of the administrative and technical staff of the Russian embassy.Croatia's Foreign Ministry said they had expressed "the strongest condemnation of the brutal aggression against Ukraine and numerous crimes committed" to the Russian ambassador who was summoned to the ministry.Many EU countries have expelled Russian diplomats since the war in Ukraine began in late February, stating that they posed a threat to the countries' national security.In another development, Slovakia has denied its S-300 air defense missile system it transported to Ukraine has been destroyed by the Russian armed forces.Our S-300 system has not been destroyed, Lubica Janikova, spokeswoman for Slovakias Prime Minister Eduard Heger said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. She said any other claim is not true.Earlier on Monday, the Russian military said it destroyed a shipment of air defense missile system provided by the West on the southern outskirts of the city of Dnipro.The Russian side said Ukraine had received the air defense system from a European country that he didnt name. Last week, Slovakia said it has handed over its Soviet-designed S-300 air defense systems to Ukraine, which has pleaded with the West to give it more weapons, including long-range air defense systems.The Ukrainian army said on Monday that they expect a Russian offensive "very soon" in the east. Many officials think eastern Ukraine has become the Kremlin's main target, after Russian troops retreated in the northern region of the country and around Kyiv.According to our information, the enemy has almost completed its preparation for an assault on the east. The attack will take place very soon, said Defense Ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk.Meanwhile, Irelands foreign minister says the European Union should consider imposing sanctions on Russias oil industry but cautions that its most important for the 27-nation bloc to remain unified.Several EU countries are dependent on Russian oil and gas imports.

We know that thats very difficult for some member states and we have to keep a united position across the EU.The EUs executive arm, the European Commission, is assessing what more can be done with a fresh package of sanctions. Coveney said the European Union is spending hundreds of millions of euros on importing oil from Russia. That is certainly contributing to financing this war.
