That's their tit for tat response."Russia's civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia said: "This measure was taken in accordance with the provisions of the Intergovernmental Air Services Agreement between Russia and the UK as a response to unfriendly decisions by the UK aviation authorities regarding the restriction on regular flights of aircraft owned, leased or operated by a person associated with Russia or registered in Russia."British Airways said in a statement it was notifying customers on canceled services and would offer full refunds."We apologize for the inconvenience but this is clearly a matter beyond our control," the airline said."We will continue to monitor the situation closely."British Airways normally operates three flights per week each way between London and Moscow.Following Russia's announcement, Virgin Atlantic also said flight paths had been adjusted for some of its services between the UK, Pakistan and India. Flight times on these routes will be extended by between 15 minutes and an hour.Virgin Atlantic apologized for the delays, adding: "The safety and security of our customers and people always come first and we're monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia extremely carefully following the escalation of conflict."Tracking data from Flightradar24 showed BA and Virgin Atlantic between Delhi, Islamabad and London are taking southern routes to avoid Russian airspace.Ukraine's airspace closed on Thursday after Russian forces launched a military invasion of the country.Moldova also said it was closing its airspace and Belarus shut part of its airspace on Thursday.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has warned of safety risks in flying in airspace near Ukraine's borders, including in Russia."There is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft," the regulator said on Thursday."The presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems pose a high risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels."The US Federal Aviation Administration has also expanded the area where it says US airlines cannot operate in and near Ukraine.Prior to Ukraine closing its airspace on Thursday, some carriers had already decided to divert flights from the region.Dutch operator KLM was the first major airline to suspend flights to the capital Kyiv on 14 February and German airline Lufthansa followed.Ryanair, the largest airline which flies between Europe and Ukraine, continued operating flights until Ukraine closed the airspace.
