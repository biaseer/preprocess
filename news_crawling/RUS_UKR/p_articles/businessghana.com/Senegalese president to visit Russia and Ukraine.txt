The Russia-Ukraine crisis has cut off supplies of grain and cooking oil, worsening food insecurity particularly in poorer African countries due to rising prices.
Senegalese President Macky Sall says he will travel to Russia and Ukraine soon in his capacity as the current chairman of the African Union.
In a joint conference with visiting German Chancellor Olaf Sholz, he said Africa was keen to see peace through dialogue between Ukraine and Russia.
The Senegalese president said Russia had extended an invitation for a visit while Ukraines president had expressed the need to communicate with African heads of state.
Global fuel prices have also risen as a result, adding the cost burden to many countries.
Mr Sall said on Sunday that he had received the mandate of other AU heads of state to make the trips.
