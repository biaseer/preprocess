Officials are preparing to organize votes in areas currently controlled by the Russian military and any others its troops are able to seize in coming weeks, three people said, Bloomberg reported on July 21.
The goal is to conduct referendums on joining Russia by September 15, two of the people said, asking not to be identified because the issue is sensitive.
