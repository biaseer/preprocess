In a tweet on Tuesday, Dmytro Kuleba said the letter in some contexts "means Russian war crimes, bombed out cities, thousands of murdered Ukrainians".
He said the letter can under certain circumstances be considered a sign of support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and could make people "criminally liable".
Comment: Except the symbol doesn't represent any of these baseless accusations, because Russia has been bombing military installations. Instead, it has gone out of its way to evacuate civilians via humanitarian corridors, that it set up and is maintaining. Only then has it targeted Ukraine's neo-Nazi aligned military, who have based themselves in residential areas in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.
A spokesman for the German Interior Ministry said on Monday that security services are aware the symbol is also being used at rallies in Germany.
Several German states have said they will open investigations into the use of the symbol.

Russian troops in Ukraine have painted the letter Z on the side of vehicles and it has been adopted by some in Russia as a symbol of support for what the Kremlin describes as a "special military operation" in the neighbouring country.
Comment: When compared to USNATO wars, Russia's incursion into Ukraine is indeed a special operation: The road to Ukraine started with 1999's Kosovo War
