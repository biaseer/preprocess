In a message to Americans in Russia on Sunday, the US embassy said: There have been threats of attacks against shopping centres, railway and metro stations, and other public gathering places in major urban areas, including Moscow and St Petersburg as well as in areas of heightened tension along the Russian border with Ukraine.
Review your personal security plans. Have evacuation plans that do not rely on US government assistance.
A spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, questioned if the US had passed on the information about possible attacks to Russia.
The US embassy in Russia has cautioned Americans to prepare evacuation plans as the crisis over Ukraine deepens, citing the threat of attacks in Moscow and along the border with the neighbour Russia seems likely to invade.
