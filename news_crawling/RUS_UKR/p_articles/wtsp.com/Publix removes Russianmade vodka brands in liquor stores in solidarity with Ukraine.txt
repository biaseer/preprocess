"Publix stands with the people of Ukraine. To show our support, we have decided to remove Russian-made vodka brands from our shelves. This is inclusive of all our liquor stores."
Over the weekend, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott asked the Texas Restaurant Association, Texas Package Stores Associationand all Texas retailers to voluntarily remove all Russian products from their shelves.
Contrary to popular belief, Stolichnaya Stoli, Romanov and Smirnoff are not Russian vodkas and will remain available.
The company says no Russian-made vodka will be available for sale, even though they will appear in the printed ad.
"Our sale circulars are printed weeks in advance, and due to that timeline, we were unable to pull this product from the printed version of the circular," said the spokesperson. "However, we have removed the ad from the online version."
The move comes amid growing pressure on businesses to ban or boycott products that come from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.
Publix has removed all Russian-made vodka brands from its shelves in a move that shows solidarity with Ukraine, a company spokesperson confirmed Wednesday.
In a follow-up email, a Publix spokesperson shared that a Russian-made vodka will be featured in a company circular to be released this week.
The company says Beluga, Ruskova, Russian Standard and Zyr have been removed from the store's liquor store shelves.
