In a sea change in its policy line to this point, the Federal Government decided on Saturday evening to supply the Ukrainian armed forces with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles from the inventory of the Bundeswehr in order to support the Ukrainian military. This was announced by government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit this evening. The weapons will be delivered to Ukraine as quickly as possible. The Russian attack on Urkaine marks a turning point, Chancellor Scholz explained. It threatens the entire post-war order. In this situation, it is our duty to support the Ukraine to the best of our ability in the defense against the invading army of Vladimir Putin. Germany is on the side of Ukraine.
