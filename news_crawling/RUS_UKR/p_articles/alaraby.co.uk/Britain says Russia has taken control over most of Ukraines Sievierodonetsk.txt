Russia has taken control of most of Ukraine's industrial city of Sievierodonetsk, Britain's defence ministry said on Thursday.
Britain said Ukraine likely remained in control of the river line in crossing sites between Sievierodonetsk and the neighbouring town of Lysychansk, and in the city of Lyman.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Russians control 70 of the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk, citing a provincial governor.
In both locations, Ukrainian forces have destroyed existing bridges, the ministry added in the intelligence update posted on Twitter.
