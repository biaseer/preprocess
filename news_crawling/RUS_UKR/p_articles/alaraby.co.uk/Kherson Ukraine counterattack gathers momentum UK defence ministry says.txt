Russia's 49th Army, stationed on the west bank of the Dnipro River, now looks highly vulnerable, British military intelligence said, adding that Kherson was virtually cut off from the other territories occupied by Russia.
Ukraine's counteroffensive is gathering momentum in the Russian-controlled southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, Britain's defence ministry said on Thursday.
"Ukrainian forces have highly likely established a bridqehead south of the lngulets River, which forms the northern boundary of Russian-occupied Kherson," it said in a regular intelligence bulletin on Twitter.
Moscow began its brutal invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and has faced heavy international condemnation and sanctions as a result.
But on Wednesday, a headquarters overseeing exports ofUkrainian grainsopenedin Istanbul after a landmark UN deal last week, and a senior Turkish official said the first ship is likely to departBlack Sea portsin a few days.
The war also endangers food supplies worldwide, including in the Middle East, since Ukraine and Russia accounted for around a third of global wheat exports before fighting broke out.
Russia and Ukraine signed the deal on Friday, brokered by Ankara and the United Nations, to reopen grain and fertiliserexportsthat have been blocked by war.
