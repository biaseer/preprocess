Bratchuk also told Ukrainian state television that seven people have been wounded, including three children.
Earlier reports said six people had died in the night-time incident in Ukraine, including three children.
"The number of dead as a result of a strike on a multi-storey apartment building has now risen to 10," Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the Odesa regional administration, said on his Telegram channel.
A Russian missile struck a nine-storey apartment building in Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa early on Friday, killing at least 10 people, a local official said.
A rescue operation was under way, he said, as some people remained buried under the rubble after a section of the building collapsed.
