Russia recognised Donetsk and Luhansk as republics on 21 February, three days before it invaded Ukraine. The Assad regime quickly backed Russia'srecognition of the breakaway regions.
Ukraine is suffering about 1,000 military deaths and injuriesa day in the Donbas region, a Ukrainian official said Wednesday.
The Syrian regime is set to recognise the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and their secession from Ukraine, a Donetsk official said Thursday.
Moscow has also backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region- also accused of war crimes - where Donetsk and Luhansk are located.
Russia is the Syrian regime's main ally, helping keep Assad propped up through years of civil war.
Syria would be the first country bar Russia to formally recognise the two parts of Ukraine as independent republics.
Pushilin said that at the meeting, Assad "announced the official start of the procedures" for recognising Donetsk.
On Thursday, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assadpledged to a delegation from Donetsk, headed by the breakaway region's self-declared foreign ministerNatalia Nikonorova, that his regime would go a step further and recognise the republics, Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People's Republic DPR said on Telegram.
"The President of the Syrian Arab Republic noted the readiness of the state to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics," the DPRs foreign ministry said.
Shortly before Russia's 24 February invasion of Ukraine, the Syrian regime and Yemen's Houthi rebels backed Moscow's recognition of the breakaway Ukrainian regions, despite international outcry.
