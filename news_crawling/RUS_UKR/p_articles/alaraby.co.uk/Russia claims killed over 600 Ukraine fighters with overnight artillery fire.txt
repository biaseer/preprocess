Russiaclaimedon Thursday that its artillery struck multiple Ukrainian positions and strongholds overnight, killing over 600 fighters.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 Februaryin what it claimed was a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out those it alleges aredangerous far-right extremists.
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.
Ukraine denies the charges and the international community has stood with Kyiv, supplying it weapons and sanctioning Russia over itsunprovoked assault.
"The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue the special military operation in Ukraine", the defence ministry said, using Moscow's name for its brutal invasion of its neighbour. "Over 600 nationalists and 61 units of weapons and military equipment were destroyed".
The defence ministry also said its missiles destroyed aviation equipment at the Kanatovo airfield in Ukraine's central Kirovohrad region and a large ammunition depot in the southern city of Mykolaiv.
