Levada conducted the survey among 1,603 respondents across 50 Russian regions between Nov. 25-Dec. 1.
The U.S. and its allies have in recent weeks said their intelligence and Russian troop movements near Ukrainian borders pointed to Moscows plans to invade Ukraine.
Russia has denied planning an invasion, saying its military maneuvers come in response to Ukraines troop buildup. Moscow has also recently stepped up accusations of NATOs eastward expansion and its deployment of weapons that threaten Moscows security.
Younger Russians, however, were more likely to say that no one is to blame for the Russian-Ukrainian tensions or not answer the question than their older counterparts.
According to Levada, 16 of Russian respondents pinned the blame for heightened tensions on Ukraine. That figure saw little change when broken down into age groups.
Two in five Russians believe war is likely to break out with Ukraine and blame the United States for heightened tensions, according to a new independent survey published Tuesday.
Only 4 blamed Russia and 3 the pro-Moscow breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine for the standoff. These figures also remained unchanged across all age groups.
Exactly half of those polled blamed the U.S. and other NATO countries for the current tensions in Ukraine.
According to the Levada Center, 39 of Russian respondents believe that war with Ukraine is either highly likely or unavoidable.
