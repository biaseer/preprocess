Putin shot down that offer, saying instead the Ukrainian leader was welcome in Moscow "any time."
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday questioned the point of meeting with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claiming his country was effectively run by leaders in Washington and European capitals.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy's chief of staff, dismissed Putin's claims of outside control as a "basic element of Russian propaganda."
After a lull in fighting last year, the conflict escalated again at the start of 2021.
In April, as Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border and in Crimea, Zelenskiy invited Putin to meet in eastern Ukraine.
Putin on Wednesday described Ukraine's leadership as "unfriendly," but said Russians and Ukrainians were close. "We are one," he said.
"I'm not refusing to meet with Zelenskiy, it's just necessary to understand what there is to talk about."
He also said the comments showed the Russian leader was misinformed by his own administration.
Kiev's conflict with separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions broke out in 2014 when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula.
Russia later announced a troop pullback, but both Washington and Kiev say that the withdrawal has been limited.
Kiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow has denied.
Speaking to AFP and other news agencies thismonth, Zelenskiy accused Russia of delaying the proposed meeting with Putin.
"What's the use of meeting with Zelenskiy when he has given full control of his country to outside management?" Putin said during an annual televised phone-in with Russians.
"Key decisions are being made in Washington, and Berlin and Paris to some extent," he added.
