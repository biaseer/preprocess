Phillips goaded Nandy with the suggestion that Labour had completely failed in one of its core duties  the government had been on the ropes thanks to various self-inflicted wounds, but no knockout blow had been landed:

January may be Eastern Europes coldest month, but most Ukrainians are unwilling to accept Vladimir Putins gigantic bear hug for comfort. Last week, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed to have seen intelligence suggesting a Russian plan to install a puppet government in Kyiv, and diplomatic efforts have not yet managed to take the chill off the situation. Truss was interviewed by Sophie Raworth, who asked her how likely it was that the situation could escalate:

LT: We want to see taxes come down but I think the public appreciate that we spent a lot of money during COVID and we do need to pay that money back.
ED: The way the Met has handled this, I think is undermining public trust This is chaos It may be a cockup, but equally it may be something worse.

LN: We cant possibly hit people with more taxes at the moment If there was a Labour government today, there would be no rise in National Insurance.
LT: Johnson will do a fantastic job winning the next election for the Conservative party
Trevor Phillips also spoke to Truss about the co-ordination of sanctions against Russia. As well as a proposed broadening of sanctions against individuals, Truss said that she would argue wholeheartedly for the cancellation of the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, running from Russia to Germany. The Nord Stream pipelines are owned by the Russian state-backed company Gazprom:
LT: Im not going to answer hypothetical questions Hes done an excellent job on the things that matter.

Truss was also stoic in her defence of the Prime Minister when challenged about his conduct by Raworth, and refused to countenance his resignation, even if it were to be established that he deliberately misled the House of Commons:

Phillips pressed Truss on the issue of the governments National Insurance rise, aimed at funding the health and social care system. Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have confirmed that the rise will go ahead in April, in the teeth of opposition from their backbenches, concerned about the current cost-of-living squeeze:

LT: One of the issues we have is European dependence on Russian gas We cannot allow that to happen.
Raworth also discussed the planned National Insurance rise with Shadow Levelling Up Secretary Lisa Nandy. Nandy was highly critical of the tax, arguing that people needed more money in their pockets to spend in their local communities:
LN: Do you want me to go down now and frogmarch Johnson out of Downing Street? If Tory MPs wont find the courage and the backbone to do the right thing, then it will be up to the British people.
And finally, the Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey sought to cast doubt on what had happened to the much-anticipated Sue Gray report into alleged Downing Street parties. The Metropolitan police have demanded that Grays report can only be published in a redacted form until they complete their own criminal investigation:
LT: We think its highly likely that Putin is looking to invade Ukraine There is a real threat of invasion, but we dont know whats going to happen.
