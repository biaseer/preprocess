"Then you should go upstairs because our Eurovision entrants are about to hold a press conference. It should be interesting  its a really good song! Alina Pash was originally chosen through a televised national selection show and was due to sing her song, Shadows Of Forgotten Ancestors.
Psiuk told Rolling Stone he was called up to fight two days after being selected as the country's Eurovision act. He said: OK, first you have to sign this form saying the Ukrainian armed forces are not responsible if you get killed here.
He gave Oleksandra a kiss before being ferried away in a taxi. Formed in 2019, the group consists of founder and rapper Oleh, multi-instrumentalist Ihor Didenchuk and dancer Vlad Kurochka.
