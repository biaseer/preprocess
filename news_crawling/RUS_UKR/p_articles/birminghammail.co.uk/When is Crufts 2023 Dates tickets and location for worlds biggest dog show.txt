If travelling there by car, the satnav postcode for the NEC is B40 1NT. Crufts is held in halls 1, 2, 3, 3A, 4, 5 and the arena and there is extensive parking at the site.
On Sunday, the last day of the show, the prices are 22 for adults and 16 for children aged 9-15, senior citizens and students. Best in Show tickets are priced 22. Tickets purchased on the door on the day are more expensive. You can get Crufts 2023 tickets at the Ticket Factory website here.
Crufts will this year see around 24,000 dogs taking part. The show returned to normality in 2022 after organisers cancelled it in 2021 because of Covid restrictions. Last year, a flat-coated retriever called Baxer won the Best In Show prize on the last day of the show, with crowd favourite Waffle - an apricot-coloured toy poodle - named as runner-up.
Organisers at The Kennel Club have announced the dates of Crufts 2023 as March 9 to March 12. A schedule of which groups will be judged on each of the four days has also been revealed:
The running order of judging for each day changes each year. All breeds are judged to come up with a best in breed, and then each of those competes to be named the group winner. All seven group winners then go up against each other in the main arena for the ultimate prize of Best in Show.
Crossbreeds compete in a separate competition at the event, called Scruffts. In addition, there are lots of agility contests and displays held throughout each day.
Crufts takes place at the Birmingham National Exhibition Centre NEC. It's been held there since 1991 after moving out of London to find bigger premises. The NEC is right next to the M6 and M42 motorway network as well as Birmingham International train station and Birmingham Airport, making it accessible for all modes of transport.
Crufts is coming back to Birmingham for 2023 for four days of competitions and activities. Whether your dog is brilliant at jumping hurdles and hoops, is one of the growing numbers of crossbreeds that are popular as pets, or has the star power to perform in the arena, the show offers something for everyone.
Tickets are on sale for Crufts 2023, with prices varying for each day.
