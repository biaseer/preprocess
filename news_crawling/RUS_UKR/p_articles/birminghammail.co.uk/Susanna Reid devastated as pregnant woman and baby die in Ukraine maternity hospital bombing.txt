Susanna Reid has been left devastated after it emerged a pregnant woman and baby were killed in a Russian airstrike on a Ukraine maternity hospital. The ITV Good Morning Britain star addressed the heartbreaking news on Monday.
Susanna said: "Before we go, sorry, we've just seen that you've tweeted this morning... A couple of day ago we saw that devastating attack on a maternity hospital and you've mentioned that the photograph that just hit us all of a woman on a stretcher being carried out.
"How terrible, I hadn't realised," Andrew Pierce said. He continued: "We all assumed she made it." His co star Kevin Maguire then chipped in, saying: "The majority of victims in wars are civilians - completely innocent."
"You've tweeted this morning: 'This baby didn't hear the sirens or explosions after all nor will she ever see the war-torn sky or any sky. The mum and baby didn't survive.'"
Susanna and Richard Madeley welcomed Ukraine MP Lesia Vasylenko onto the show. The politician appeared via video link from Strasbourg.
