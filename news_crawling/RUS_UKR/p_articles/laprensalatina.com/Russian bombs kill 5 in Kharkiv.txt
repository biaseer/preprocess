She told Efe that she heard the first of the missiles as she made her way to the station, where she had agreed to meet with Oleksiy, 65.
As she approached the station, she came across an injured person on the floor and tried to administer first aid using gauze bandages.
The 64-year-old had called her husband before the rocket attack after noticing he had forgotten his keys on his way to work.
Kharkiv, Ukraine, May 26 EFE.- Russian missile strikes killed at least five people and injured 10 more in Kharkiv, Ukraines second largest city, on Thursday.
At least two Russian bombs fell next to the station, the second hitting just as an ambulance arrived to evacuate the wounded.
The blasts hit various points in the city of two million people at around 3pm local time, including the vicinity of the 23 Serpina metro station where Elena, who preferred not to give her full name, found the body of her husband Oleksiy.
Kharkiv lies close to the Russian border and was a focal point of Moscows military aggression in the early stages of the invasion. EFE
Emergency service workers tried to revive the individual but it was too late. The man they attended was Oleksiy.
Yegor, who also preferred not to provide his full name, told Efe he had seen a man get hit by shrapnel as he descended the stairs into the station.
She then heard the second explosion and when she tried to call her husband, she got no response.
