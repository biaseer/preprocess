Russian people have achieved great successes in accomplishing the just cause of defending the dignity and security of their country and its right to development while braving all sorts of challenges and hardships under the guidance of the president, said the North Korean leader.
The leader stressed that the ties between Moscow and Pyongyang had entered a new phase after a bilateral summit between the leaders in 2019.
Kim sent a congratulatory message to Putin and the people of Russia, without directly referring to the Ukraine war, as per a report published by North Koreas state news agency KCNA.
The dialog between Washington and Pyongyang has remained stalled since the failed summit, with the peninsula witnessing fresh tensions due to North Koreas repeated missile tests and the allies responses.
Kim reaffirmed the long history and tradition of friendship and good neighborhood between the two countries and pledged to expand and develop them in keeping with the requirement of the new times and the desire of the peoples of the two countries, according to the message.
Seoul, Jun 12 EFE.- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Sunday extended his full support to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Russias national day.
He expressed hope that the strategic and tactical cooperation between the two countries would get closer in future.
The two leaders met in Vladivostok in April 2019, soon after the second bilateral summit between Kim and then United States president Donald Trump in Hanoi to discuss the disarmament of Korean Peninsula.
