Darya Dugina, 29, daughter of Alexandr Dugin, died when a bomb under her vehicle detonated on the outskirts of Moscow.
Moscow, Aug 22 EFE.- Russian intelligence services on Monday accused Ukraines secret service of planting a car bomb that killed the daughter of a prominent propagandist and Vladimir Putin ally in Moscow over the weekend.
The agent and her daughter had rented an apartment in the same building as Dugina, the report claimed.
The FSB said the agent moved around Russia with a Kazakh-registered car and fled the country after the attack using a Ukrainian registration. She escaped to Estonia, the FSB, the post-Soviet successor to the KGB, alleged.
It claimed, in a statement, that the agent had arrived in Russia in July with her daughter in a car registered to the breakaway region of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, a territory that Moscow recognizes as independent from Kyiv.
Russias Federal Security Service FSB said the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian agent identified as Natalia Vovk.
