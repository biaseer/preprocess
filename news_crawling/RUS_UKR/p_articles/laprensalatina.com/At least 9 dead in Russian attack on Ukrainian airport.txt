Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Sunday denounced Russian plans to bomb the southern Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odesa after the destruction of the Vinnytsia airport.
In a video posted on his Telegram account, Zelenskyy said the Vinnytsia airport was destroyed after Russian missiles hit it.
The fatalities occurred Sunday when eight Russian missiles hit the civil-military dual-use airport in the Vinnytsia city in western Ukraine.
Searchers recovered 15 bodies on Monday from the rubble of the almost wiped-out airport, said the rescue agency on its official Telegram account.
If they do not do this, give us planes so we can defend ourselves, he said. EFE
Lviv, Ukraine, Mar 7 EFE.- At least nine people, including five civilians, were killed when Russian forces bombarded an airport in Ukraine a day ago, the State Emergency Service said on Monday.
Zelenskyy again called on NATO to declare Ukraine a no-fly zone, a proposal the alliance has ruled out for now.
The brutal and cynical missile attack left the airport completely destroyed. They continue to destroy our infrastructure, our life, which we, our parents, our grandparents, generations of Ukrainians built.
