The G7 group, which comprises the UK, Germany, France, the United States, Canada, Italy and Japan, also warned that Iran was running out of time to find a way to salvage its 2015 nuclear agreement with the world powers.
London, Dec 12 EFE.- The foreign ministers of the Group of Seven G7 economies on Sunday said Russia would face harsh consequences if it launches an attack on Ukraine.
We have been clear that any incursion by Russia into Ukraine will have massive consequences for which there would be a severe cost, The United Kingdoms Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.
This is the last chance for Iran to come to the negotiating table with a serious resolution to this issue, which has to be agreeing the terms of the JCPOA acronym of the deals formal name, Truss said.
Former president Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and re-imposed the harsh economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Negotiations to revive the accord have resumed earlier this month in Vienna after a five-month hiatus, with the US taking part indirectly.
For this reason, Truss said that what we want to do is build the investment reach, the economic trade reach, of like-minded, freedom-loving democracies.EFE
The stark warning at the summit taking place in the northern English city of Liverpool comes as Russia has been building up troops near the Ukrainian border in recent weeks.
Alongside Russia and Iran, the G7 also voiced its concerns about Chinas coercive economic policies.
In response, Iran downscaled its compliance to the deal, which restricted its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions.
