Russia recently announced a temporary ceasefire starting at 10 am local time 07.00 GMT to open humanitarian corridors in Kyiv north, Mariupol south-east, Kharkiv east, and Sumy north-east with six routes, four of which lead to Russian cities.
She added that the Russians now look to open the corridors, but want all civilians to enter Russian territory, which is absurd and unacceptable to Ukraine.
Ukraines Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Telegram that on two occasions the Russians blocked the opening of humanitarian corridors by bombing the convoys route.
Vereshchuk stressed that the global community must exert pressure on Russia, as Ukraine urgently needs humanitarian corridors for its civilian population in its cities facing Russian missile and artillery assault.
She also asked the people not to trust in any information regarding the humanitarian corridors except those provided by the Ukrainian government. EFE
