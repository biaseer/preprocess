Kyiv, Jun 27 EFE.- At least 10 people were killed and 40 others were injured after a Russian missile struck a shopping mall in central Ukraine on Monday, Dmytro Lunin, the governor of the Poltava region, said.
Six of them are in serious condition. In addition, 29 people were provided with outpatient care without hospitalization, including two children, Lunin added.
Ten dead and over 40 people received injuries  in Kremenchuk as a result of rocket shelling, Lunin said in a statement on social media, adding that 21 people were injured and hospitalized.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that there were over 1,000 civilians inside the building when it was struck.
The mall is on fire, firefighters are trying to extinguish the fire, the number of victims is impossible to imagine, he said.
Images from the strike in the city Kremenchuk appeared to show a large fire had engulfed the building, which Zelenskyy said posed no threat to Russia and held no strategic value.
It is expected that the number of dead and injured from the shelling will continue to rise.
Out of helplessness, Russia continues to hit ordinary people. It is vain to expect it to be reasonable or humane, he added.
