Strasbourg, France, Apr 5 EFE.- European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the blocs top diplomat Josep Borrell will travel to Kyiv this week to meet with Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met with Zelenskyy in a show of support in mid-March, when much of the capitals northern outskirts was occupied by invading Russian troops. EFE
The harrowing reports and images that have emerged from Bucha since Ukraines forces regained control of the town prompted EU leaders to start drafting a new raft of sanctions against Moscow.
It will be the first visit to Kyiv by von der Leyen and Borrell since Russia launched its invasion in late February and comes after the European Union accused the Kremlin of carrying out war crimes, including the summary execution of civilians, in the town of Bucha, located just outside the Ukrainian capital.
The pair will hold a meeting in the Ukrainian capital before attending the Stand Up For Ukraine global pledging event in Warsaw on Saturday, Commission spokesman Eric Mamer confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday.
