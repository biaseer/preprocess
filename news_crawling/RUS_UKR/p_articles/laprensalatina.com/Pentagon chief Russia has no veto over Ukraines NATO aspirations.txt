Ukraines defence minister Taran said that the parties discussed collaboration under the US-Ukraine framework agreement on military cooperation, signed in August during the visit of Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskyi to Washington.
He was responding to recent statements by the Kremlin that Ukraines NATO membership would be a red line.
They discussed the issue of military cooperation in the Black Sea region and how to protect it against Russian aggression, he added.EFE
NATO allies expressed support for Ukraines efforts to become a fully-fledged NATO member. We support the defense reform, which will help Ukraine to reach the membership criteria, Austin said.
No third country has a right to veto Ukraines NATO membership. Ukraine has a right to decide its future and its foreign policy without external intervention, Austin said at a briefing in Ukraines capital along with Ukrainian defense minister Andrii Taran.
Kiev, Oct 19 EFE.- Russia cannot veto Ukraines aspirations to become a NATO member, the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said in Kiev Tuesday.
Our support to Ukraine is unwavering and we will continue to work together to make sure Ukraine can defend itself, he said, adding that since the start of Russian aggression in Ukraine in 2014 the US has allocated $2.5 billion to support Ukrainian armed forces.
