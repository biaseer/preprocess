Ukraines prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova told reporters at the scene that Russias actions in the region amounted to crimes against humanity.
This grisly discovery adds further weight to allegations that Russian troops committed war crimes against civilians during their one-month occupation of the town west of Kyiv, the capital.
Another 6 bodies of Ukrainian civilians were found on Tuesday in the city of Brovary, in the east of the Kyiv region, the districts prosecutor general reported in a Telegram message.
Tuesdays discovery coincided with the arrival of a team of French experts who traveled to Bucha to help with the investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops.
Its very important to get decisions from the International Criminal Court and other international courts, Venediktova said. Thats why it is important that investigators and experts from other jurisdictions can come to Ukraine.
Here in the Kyiv region we see a large quantity of war crimes, she added.EFE
Russian troops withdrew from the region last week ahead of a regroup to focus on eastern and southern Ukraine.
Bucha, Ukraine, Apr 12 EFE.- An unmarked grave containing 10 bodies was uncovered in the Ukrainian town of Bucha on Tuesday, local authorities reported.
The victims, allegedly killed by Russian forces, were found with gunshot wounds in the basement of a private residence, the prosecutor said.
The bodies of at least 1,222 civilians have been discovered in the Kyiv region alone, of which 250 were recovered in Bucha, several dozen in unmarked graves like the one unearthed on Tuesday.
The international specialists examined the 10 corpses in the latest unmarked grave, some of which were charred from burning, and transferred them to a vehicle for further testing.
