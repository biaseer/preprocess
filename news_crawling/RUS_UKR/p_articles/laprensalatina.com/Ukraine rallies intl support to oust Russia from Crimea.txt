Russias efforts to legitimize the temporary occupation and illegal seizure are unacceptable, the statement added.
At the opening of the summit, he said the countdown to the moment when Crimea will return to Ukrainian control had begun.
Kiev, Aug 23 EFE.- Representatives of 46 states and international organizations committed to support Ukraines efforts to end Russias annexation of the Crimean peninsula at a summit in Kiev on Monday.
We conducted a summit at which a strong international coalition was created with the goal to liberate Crimea from the occupation by the Russian Federation, Zelenski said.
Any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol as an integral part of the sovereign territory of Ukraine is not and will not be recognized, the participants said in the final declaration.
The summit condemned the continued violations and abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Crimea by Russian occupation authorities, vowing to consider further political, diplomatic and restrictive measures  should Russias actions so require.
In his closing remarks at the summit, Ukraines president Volodimir Zelenski said this was a historic day for his country.
