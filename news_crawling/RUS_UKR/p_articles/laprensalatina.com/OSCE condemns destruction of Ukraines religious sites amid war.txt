Vienna, Aug 22 EFE.- The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE on Monday denounced the destruction of religious buildings in Ukraine during the Russian invasion of the country.
Christians, Muslims, Jews, those of other religious beliefs, and those with no religious belief are among the victims killed in Russian military strikes, it added.
The continued Russian aggression against Ukraine brings more death, new refugees, and the destruction of civilian sites, including houses of worship and religious shrines and memorials, the OSCE said in a statement.
The religious leaders in Russia willingly or under coercion provide a rationale for this unprovoked war. Those who would speak out or even remain silent do so at their own peril, the organization explained.
Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, openly supported the invasion, which led the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to officially split from the Russian church in Moscow in May.
