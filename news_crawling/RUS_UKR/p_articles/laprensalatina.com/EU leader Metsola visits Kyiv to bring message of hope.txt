Ukrainians resistance and courage have inspired the world. I am in Kyiv to give a message of hope. We are with you, Metsola posted on Twitter.

We will take care of your families who have been forced to flee, until they can safely return to their homes and rebuild their lives, she added.
Brussels, Apr 1 EFE.- President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola visited Kyiv on Friday in a show of support for Ukrainians amid Russias invasion.
Soon we will help you rebuild your cities and your towns when this illegal, unprovoked and unnecessary war is over, she told a press conference in Kyiv.
Metsola is the first top representative of an EU institution to travel to Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion on February 24. EFE
We have already provided financial, military and humanitarian assistance, this will continue and it will increase.
