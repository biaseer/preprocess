The comparison was criticized by Conservative peer Lord Barwell, who reminded Johnson that Ukraine is seeking to join the European Union.
Meanwhile, Donald Tusk, who was the president of the EU during the process of Britains exit in 2016, said the British PMs words offend Ukrainians, the British and common sense.
Johnsons remarks were made during a speech to a conference of his Conservative Party in the English city of Blackpool on Saturday, saying it is the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, citing the Brexit vote as a famous recent example.
To compare a referendum to women and children fleeing Russian president Vladimir Putins bombs is an insult to every Ukrainian, he added.
Barwell, who served as chief of staff to former prime minister Theresa May, wrote on Twitter that voting in a free and fair referendum isnt in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion.
Its because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.
When the British people voted for Brexit in such large, large numbers, I dont believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners.
I can still remember the enthusiasm of Putin and former US president Donald Trump after the referendum, the former Polish prime minister said.
Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party in Westminster, said that Johnsons comments comparing Ukraines life-threatening situation with Brexit was crass and distasteful, and shows just how dangerously obsessed the Tories are with Brexit.
London, Mar 20 EFE.- British prime minister Boris Johnson on Sunday was criticized for comparing the situation of Ukrainians fighting the Russian invasion to British people voting for Brexit.
