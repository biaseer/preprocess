A leading figure in independent Russian journalism since the 1990s, Muratov said he believes Russias president Vladimir Putin seeks to absorb Ukraines eastern Donbas region into Russia.EFE
The biggest tragedy of it all is that nobody could possibly stop this decision from being taken, not the parliament, not civil society, not the public, not even Lenin, he added.
Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent Novaya Gazeta, which suspended operations at the end of March amid the threat of reprisals from the Russian government, took part in a Geneva event marking World Press Freedom Day alongside his fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Filipino-American journalist Maria Ressa.
Geneva, May 3 EFE.- Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, on Tuesday said that he would not rule out the possibility of nuclear weapons being used in Russias invasion of Ukraine.
Earlier, Maria and I spoke in a different room and I told her that I do not rule out the possibility that nuclear weapons might be used, he told the panel.
