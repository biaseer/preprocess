Given the ongoing war since the Russian invasion of this years winning country, the EBU has taken the time to conduct a full assessment and feasibility study with both UA:PBC Ukraines public broadcasting service and third-party specialists including on safety and security issues, the EBU said in a statement.
Ukraine was slated to host next years Eurovision Song Contest after winning the competition in May this year.
It is our full intention that Ukraines win will be reflected in next years shows. This will be a priority for us in our discussions with the eventual hosts, EBU concluded. EFE
Geneva, Jun 17 EFE.- Eurovision 2023 will not be held in Ukraine due security issues caused by Russias invasion, the European Broadcasting Union said Friday.
EBU said it shared Ukraines sadness and disappointment that next years Contest could not be held in Ukraine and that it was in talks with the BBC to potentially host the contest in the United Kingdom.
Following objective analysis, the Reference Group, the ESCs governing board, has with deep regret concluded that, given the current circumstances, the security and operational guarantees required for a broadcaster to host, organize and produce the Eurovision Song Contest under the ESC Rules cannot be fulfilled by UA:PBC, EBU said.
