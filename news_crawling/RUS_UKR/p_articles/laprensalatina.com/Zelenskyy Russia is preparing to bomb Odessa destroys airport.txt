Kyiv, Mar 6 EFE.- Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday denounced Russian plans to bomb the southern Ukrainian Black Sea port city of Odessa and the destruction of a western airport hit by eight Russian missiles.
They continue to destroy our infrastructure, our life, which we, our parents, our grandparents, generations of Ukrainians built, he added.
And now what? Bombs on Odessa? Artillery on Odessa? Missiles on Odessa? It will be a war crime. It will be a historical crime, he added.
If they dont do this, give us planes so we can defend ourselves, he said. EFE
The Russians have always come to Odessa. They have always felt only warmth in Odessa, only sincerity.
In a video posted on his Telegram account, Zelenskyy said that an airport near the western Vinnytsia city was totally destroyed after being hit by eight Russian missiles.
They are preparing to bomb Odessa. Odessa! the Ukrainian president said in a video message.
Zelenskyy once again called on the Nato to declare Ukraine a no-fly zone, a proposal the alliance has ruled out for now.
