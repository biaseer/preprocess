We have ratified the path of powerful military cooperation between Russia and Venezuela for the defense of peace, sovereignty, territorial integrity, Nicols Maduro said in a statement at Miraflores presidential palace after a meeting with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov.
Following their meeting on Wednesday, neither Maduro nor Borisov referred to that statement nor its implication on the ground.
When asked whether Moscow was considering the possibility of deploying its military infrastructure in Venezuela or Cuba, Ryabkov replied that he did not want to confirm anything but would also rule out nothing in this regard.
Instead, the Venezuelan president said that another world is possible, a multipolar and multicentric one, in which there are no hegemonic empires. EFE
