The peninsula of Crimea, which is part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in March 2014 as a result of armed intervention and a "referendum," which Ukrainian and Western authorities considered illegal.
"We proceed from the fact that officially, as before, Belarus supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state within its internationally recognized borders. A change in Belarus' approach to recognizing de jure the temporarily occupied Crimea as Russian territory would lead to irreversible consequences for Ukrainian-Belarusian relations," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said on November 10.
Last week, Aliaksandr Lukashenka, who is illegally holding power in Belarus, complained that Vladimir Putin did not take him with him to Crimea. Lukashenka also asked Putin, who was on the peninsula at the time, to send the Crimeans greetings on the Day of People's Unity, which was celebrated on November 4.
Commenting on this statement, Andrei Savinykh, a member of the "house of representatives" of the "national assembly" of the Republic of Belarus, said that Minsk de facto and de jure recognized Crimea as a Russian region long ago. According to him, Lukashenka's statement was an excuse to "formalize it for the media space."
Belarusian Foreign Minister Uladzimir Makei said in Moscow on November 10 that Belarus' position on Crimea remains what it was. "We understand in reality that Crimea is now Russian territory. Let's proceed from that," he said, reports Polskie Radio.
