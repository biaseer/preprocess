"Ukraine establishes a complete embargo on the import of goods from Russia. We legally secured the actual termination of trade relations with the Russian Federation, which took place on February 24. Today we formalized the complete cessation of trade in goods with the aggressor state. From now on, no Russian products can be imported into the territory of our state. The corresponding resolution was adopted today by the government," the statement says.
This was announced by First Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Economy of Ukraine Yulia Sviridenko, Ukrinform reports.
Ukraine establishes a complete embargo on the import of goods from Russia, which, according to the Ministry of Economy, will annually block foreign exchange earnings of the Russian Federation by $6 billion.
According to the Ministry of Economy, the ban on Russian imports will block foreign exchange earnings of the Russian Federation by $6 billion annually. The budget of the enemy will not receive these funds, which means that their potential to finance the war will decrease.
"Such a step by Ukraine can serve as an example for our Western partners, and will encourage them to strengthen sanctions against Russia. Among them is the introduction of an energy embargo and the isolation of all Russian banks. It is precisely such actions that will become our contribution to the bleeding of the Russian economy and, thus, will contribute to our victory," Sviridenko noted.
It should be noted that the statement does not mention the Republic of Belarus, which means that Ukraine's trade with the criminal Lukashenka regime will continue.
