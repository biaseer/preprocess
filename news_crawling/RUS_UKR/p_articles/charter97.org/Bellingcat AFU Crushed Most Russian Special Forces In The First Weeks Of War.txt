Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed a huge number of Russian special forces in the first weeks of a full-scale military invasion of the Russian Federation of Ukraine. Christo Grozev, the head of the Bellingcat international research project, spoke about it the Radio NV news publisher.
According to him, Russia is facing a shortage of "trained people in the army" due to huge losses. Therefore, the Russians recruit soldiers with combat experience for the war in Ukraine almost openly and without any collusion.
"This is one of the reasons why they forget so fast about any claims that they aren't engaged in PMC, work through PMC. It's very similar to the action movie situation when a negative hero realizes that everyone already knows that he is bad, that he is evil and there is no need to look for even more difficult paths so as not to show the real face. We are at the same stage," Grozev said.
