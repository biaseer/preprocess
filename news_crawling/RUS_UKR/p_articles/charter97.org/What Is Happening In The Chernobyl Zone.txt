Activity is visible on the Belarusian territory on Pripyat at the location of the pontoon crossing, which was built by the Russian troops before the offensive 5 kilometres to the border of Ukraine. The roads to the crossing have become noticeably brighter over the past month. This indicates that the roads are being used.
The Chernobyl exclusion zone continues to change after the failure of the Russian offensive in northern Ukraine. The Flagshtok found some changes on the Sentinel-hub satellite images.
The road bridge across the Pripyat near Chernobyl, which the Russian army used to deliver troops to the western part of the Kyiv region 10 kilometres from the border of Belarus, was partially destroyed. The collapse occurred after the retreat of the Russian troops in the second half of April.
