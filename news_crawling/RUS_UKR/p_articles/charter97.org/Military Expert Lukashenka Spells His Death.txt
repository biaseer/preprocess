Belarusians themselves can destroy the dictator since everyone is tired of him for a long time.
Russian President Vladimir Putin does not leave attempts to drag Belarus into the war against Ukraine. If he succeeds, he will try to make it attack a NATO country, suggests Valentyn Badrak, director of the Center for Army Conversion and Disarmament Studies.
Badrak believes that Lukashenka's statements about alleged readiness to fight side by side with Russia against the West testify rather to the reluctance of Belarusians to participate in the war. Disinterested, demotivated Belarusians will become a burden for Russian groups, not help. And Putin understands this perfectly well.
Putin is aware that disinterested, demotivated Belarusians are a burden, not a replenishment. The offensive order against Ukraine is a death penalty for Lukashenka with 50:50 chances. "Belarusians themselves can destroy the dictator since everyone is tired of him for a long time," Badrak emphasized.
Putin needs Belarus for one thing  to transfer the war from the Russian-Ukrainian to the international level. And this is Putin's last argument. Putin expects that in the event of such a scenario, the war acquires the status of an international conflict. If he touches a NATO country with Lukashenka's hands, this is a reason to force NATO to sit across the negotiation table to put an end to the war, the expert stressed on the air of the Espresso edition.
