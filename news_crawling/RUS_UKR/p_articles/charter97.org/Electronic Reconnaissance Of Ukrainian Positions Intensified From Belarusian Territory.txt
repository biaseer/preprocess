The Russian occupiers are building up their forces and means of electronic intelligence near the regions of Ukraine bordering Belarus.
On August 24, Ukrainian intelligence announced that there was no threat of a ground operation from Belarus yet.
The press-center of the office noted on Facebook that in the Volyhnia and Palesse directions, there is an increase in the forces and means of electronic intelligence.
They recalled that the Lukashenka regime was already participating in the war, providing its airfields for air strikes on Ukrainian settlements, repairing damaged Russian military equipment, and recruiting Belarusians to participate in direct hostilities against Ukraine.
