In turn, the Russian opposition publicist Andrei Piontkovski is sure that the liberation of Kherson from the occupiers will plunge the Russian Federation into a real shock, and the entire 'pyramid of lies' will collapse there.
Recall that earlier military expert Oleg Zhdanov said that Ukraine was not ready to liberate Kherson from Russian occupiers. However, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are located at a distance of 17 kilometers from it.
The American Institute for the Study of War ISW claims that the Ukrainian army continues to set conditions for a counteroffensive toward Kherson.
"FIRMS remotely sensed data showed a high number of fires along the Kherson-Mykolaiv and Kherson-Dnipropetrovsk region border. Geolocated footage showed Ukrainian and Russian forces engaged in artillery fire near Snihurivka and Andriivka on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region border. The Ukrainian Southern Operational Command added that Russian forces launched missile strikes on residential infrastructure in Nechayane approximately 33 km west of Mykolaiv City. Still, Russian Telegram channels claimed that Russian missiles struck Ukrainian positions," the message reads.
On July 6, the ISW said, that Russian forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations in the northwestern Kherson region and were continuing to fire artillery throughout the Southern Axis to repel Ukrainian counteroffensives.
