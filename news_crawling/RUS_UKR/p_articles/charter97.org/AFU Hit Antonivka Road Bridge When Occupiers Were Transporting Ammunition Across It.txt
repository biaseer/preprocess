According to Khlan, the impact on the bridge was "very powerful" and caused the enemy's ammunition to detonate.
When Ukrainian defenders on Monday, August 22, delivered another blow to the Antonivka road bridge in the temporarily occupied territory of the Kherson region, they were driven by a convoy of Russian trucks carrying ammunition. This was stated by the deputy of the Kherson Regional Council Serhiy Khlan on Facebook.
Referring to witnesses, he noted that the Antonivka road bridge was probably so damaged this time that the occupiers would no longer be able to use it for transportation or repair it for future supplies.
"The Armed Forces of Ukraine did not just hit the bridge, but did it at the very moment when a convoy of Russian vehicles with ammunition was moving along it. People call, they say that they dont remember this yet," he said.
