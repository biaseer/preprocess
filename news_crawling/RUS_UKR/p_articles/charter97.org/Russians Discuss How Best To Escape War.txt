"I offered to blow a fking grenade yesterday, the RGD. So make loads of 300 from eight people at once. Overlay with plates so that the limbs stick out. Just to fk it up, and that's. With three mults three million roubles, which must be paid for a combat wound - ed., everyone will go home, one of the occupiers says on the published record.
It is noted that they consider becoming a cargo 300 a real way, but there is a problem: hospitals refuse to accept the occupiers for treatment and give them sick leave. Therefore, the invaders began to discuss how to inflict wounds on themselves so that they look like combat ones.
The Defence Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine published an intercepted conversation of the occupiers.
The Russian occupiers are discussing ways to escape the war in Ukraine. In particular, the invaders are considering options for simulating battle injuries.
