"Invaders from the 38th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Vitebsk Order of Lenin, Red Banner, Order of Suvorov started asking to go home after several clashes with the AFU," the media reports. "The elite brigade was almost completely destroyed, which forced the generals to withdraw the remnants of the "glorious unit" to Russian territory. It is there that the occupants have already started writing refusals and resignation letters, just to avoid encountering the Ukrainian armed forces again".
The first month of the war brought the Russians gains only in Volnovakha, which they did occupy, wiping it out. On other fronts, the Russians suffered losses, which prevented them from advancing deep into Ukraine.
It was after such large-scale losses that the Russian military began to refuse to go into battle.
"In the first weeks of the full-scale war, we destroyed a complete BTGr from the 20th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of Precarpathian-Berlin, Red Banner, Order of Suvorov along with its equipment. It belongs to military unit 22220 and is stationed in Volgograd. Only 60 out of 900 men managed to come out of the fighting against the defenders of Ukraine alive," the mass media reported, quoting sources in the special services.
The Russian troops' losses seem humiliating also because they did not move in huge columns, had no supply problems and enjoyed the fire support of artillery and aviation. But this did not help them against the AFU.
Ukrainian defenders have almost completely eliminated two elite units of Russian troops in Donbass. The AFU "grinded down the enemy on an industrial scale", Channel 24 reports, and this helped stop the Russian offensive in the region.
