"Putin's unleashed war of aggression with Ukraine, and in fact with the entire Western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but perhaps the most serious crime against the people of Russia," he wrote on his LinkedIn page.
Bondarev, according to the website of the UN office in Geneva, served as an adviser to the permanent mission. He had been in the diplomatic service for 20 years, he said. "Unfortunately, during those 20 years, the level of lies and unprofessionalism in the work of the Foreign Ministry has been increasing all the time," the diplomat said.
Boris Bondarev, a member of the Russian permanent mission to the UN in Geneva, has announced his resignation in protest over the war against Ukraine. He said he had never been so ashamed of his country and his work throughout his diplomatic service, Radio Svoboda reported.
Bondarev has probably become the first Russian career diplomat who has officially announced his resignation because of the war. The Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on it.
According to Bondarev, the Russian Foreign Ministry is no longer engaged in diplomacy, but in "warmongering, hatred and war." "Russia has no allies left," he wrote, attributing this to Moscow's aggressive policy. He said he would like to continue his career, but believes that continuing the state service now is equivalent to betraying the motherland.
