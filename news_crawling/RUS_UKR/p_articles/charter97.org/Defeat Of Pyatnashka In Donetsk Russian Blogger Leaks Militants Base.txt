The journalists analyzed the accounts of the liquidated Pyatnashka members, and then came across a video of Kukushkin, who often visited the terrorists. After a thorough analysis, the investigators learned about the precise coordinates of the base.
Earlier, on August 22, explosions were heard in Donetsk. Eyewitnesses report the explosions were taking place at a Russian ammunition depot.
Ukrainian journalists found the coordinates of the occupants' base in Donetsk thanks to the Russian blogger Pavel Kukushkin, who "leaked" a video of the invaders' location. The AFU defeated it.
Occupiers assured the dead were "volunteers who had never held a weapon in their hands". However, journalists learned that those liquidated were fighters of the Pyatnashka brigade. Pushilin is a patron of this brigade.
Then the head of the Luhansk OVA, Serhiy Haidai, reported that the base of the Pyatnashka international gang in Donetsk, captured by DPR militants, was on fire. There are many destroyed and wounded militants. The enemy's modern equipment is destroyed.
Investigators of the project came across the base of the Pyatnashka brigade and shared data with the Ukrainian soldiers. In particular, the journalists were interested in the funerals of three people held on July 12 in the DPR. Denis Pushilin, the leader of the DPR terrorists, and Sergei Kiriyenko, deputy head of Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration, spoke at the funeral ceremony.
The investigators provided all the data about the Pyatnashka base to the AFU. They destroyed the Pushilin terrorists' lair as well as the ammunition depots.
