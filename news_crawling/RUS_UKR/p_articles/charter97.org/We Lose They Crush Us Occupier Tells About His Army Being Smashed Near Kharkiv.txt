The Russian occupant complained to his mother that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroying the Russian army near Kharkiv.
Well, they are making a rosy picture for you on TV. In fact, everything is completely different here. They will never show this on TV, they will never tell the truth. We are losing They are crushing us, the occupier says.
The telephone conversation between the invader and his mother was intercepted by the SBU. In the conversation, the Russian soldier talks about losses, the failure of offensive attempts, and notes that the reality is significantly different from the information of the Kremlin propagandists.
