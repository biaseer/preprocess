We remind you that according to British intelligence, the Russian Black Sea Fleet is no longer capable of holding parades after a series of failures.
"The limited effectiveness of the Black Sea Fleet undermines Russia's overall invasion strategy, in part because the maritime threat to Odesa has now been largely eliminated. This means that Ukraine can divert resources to put pressure on Russian ground forces somewhere else," the British Defence Ministry said.
According to the British intelligence, the Black Sea Fleet continues to use long-range cruise missiles to support ground offensives, but is currently experiencing difficulties in controlling the sea effectively. It has lost its flagship, the Moskva cruiser, a significant proportion of its naval combat aircraft and has lost control of Snake Island.
Russia's Black Sea Fleet surface ships continue to act on the defensive. Patrolling is generally limited to the waters within sight of the Crimean coastline.
"This contrasts with increased Russian naval activity in other seas, typical for this time of year," it said.
