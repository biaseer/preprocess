Also, Oleksiy Reznikov stressed that many people did not believe in the ability of the Ukrainian defence forces to hit the Moskva cruiser either. However, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet has eventually sunk.
Ukraine is not restricted in its ability to strike Russian military facilities in seized Crimea and other occupied territories. Kyiv has an agreement with Washington, according to which Ukrainian troops will not strike Russian territory. But there are no such conditions with regard to the Russian-occupied lands. This was stated by Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.
In an interview with the Voice of America, he said that Ukrainian defence forces, following the agreements with the United States, were not going to strike at Russian territory. However, there are no such restrictions when it comes to Ukrainian land seized by Russian occupiers.
"We have agreements with the United States that we will not use weapons provided to us by the United States and partners on Russian Federation territory. But if we are talking today about the de-occupation of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, where the enemy is, then accordingly we have no such restrictions. As far as weapons are concerned, any weapon has an appropriate range. Therefore, depending on from which point, from which location a target is or is planned to be hit, it means whether a particular target can be reached or not," Reznikov explained.
