Lukashenka's Foreign Ministry accepted "with respect and understanding" Putin's decision to recognize the independence of the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics. It is stated on the official webpage of the government agency.
In such a situation, we perceive with respect and understanding the decision of the Russian side to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics, the ministry said.
This step by Russia has not only a political, but also a serious human and humanitarian dimension, given the number of Russian citizens living in these territories and experiencing hardship for almost eight years, the Foreign Ministry said.
