The Ukrainian counteroffensive north of Kharkiv city continued to successfully push Russian forces toward the Russia-Ukraine border. The soldiers managed to liberate several towns.
This is stated in the summary of the Institute for the Study of War ISW.
Experts also forecast that the counteroffensive will impede the ability of Russian artillery to target the northeastern suburbs of Kharkiv City, and will potentially enable Ukrainian forces to threaten Russian rear areas.
The Ukrainian counteroffensive will likely continue to divert Russian troops and resources from deployment to other axes of advance where fighting has been similarly stalled out by the successful Ukrainian defense, the summary says.
According to experts, this counteroffensive will paralyze the offensive actions of the occupiers in the Izyum region, the location they tried to use for encirclement of the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas.
A successful offensive will allow the Armed Forces of Ukraine to attack the grouping of Russian troops from behind.
The counteroffensive continued north of Staryi Saltiv. Russian forces from the Izyum area are reportedly redeploying northwards to attempt to alleviate the pressure of this counteroffensive and stymie further northward advances toward the Russian border.
