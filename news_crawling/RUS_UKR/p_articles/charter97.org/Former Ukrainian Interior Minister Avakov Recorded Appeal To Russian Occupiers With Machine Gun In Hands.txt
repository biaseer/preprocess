The statement is addressed "to the insane scoundrels who have unleashed this war against Ukraine".
"What can I tell you? I am here. We are on our land. In Kiev. And we are waiting for you. And this is not a flash mob. You want a flash mob? Thousands and millions of Ukrainians will defend their land. We are ready to do a lot for the values. And you - definitely not," Avakov said.
