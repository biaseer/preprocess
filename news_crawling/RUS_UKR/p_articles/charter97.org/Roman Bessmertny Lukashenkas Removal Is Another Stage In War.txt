-, as long as the Lukashenka regime is in power, the northern regions of Ukraine will be in danger. How can Ukraine solve Lukashenka's issue?
- What is the Kremlin's intention regarding the use of the territory of Belarus for the shelling of Ukrainian territory? Does Putin want to set Ukrainians and Belarusians against each other?
- I said so cautiously that everything depended on the decision of the Ukrainian political and military leadership. This is why the current situation is in such a temporary state. I believe the decisions you enumerate have matured and should be taken. It would be right.
- Most of the missiles were launched from the Zyabrovka airfield, which was handed over to full Russian control by Lukashenka not so long ago. Is it time to hit Russian bases on the territory of Belarus?
- Rockets heading from the territory of Belarus hit the Chernihiv and Kyiv region again. Is it a coincidence that it happened on the day of Ukrainian statehood?
- Putin will do his best to internationalize this war. One can look at the talk after Sweden's and Finland's statement about joining NATO, the recent rhetoric of Lukashenka and Putin after the decision of the Lithuanian leadership regarding the clearance of goods to Kaliningrad, and possible strikes on the Suvalki corridor, which the Kremlin voiced. To say nothing of other points.
One should understand both the Kremlin leader and the Belarusian self-proclaimed dictator are equally responsible for the aggression from the territory of Belarus. I have repeatedly stated that another article awaits Lukashenka. In addition to the war with Ukraine, he is also waging a war against his people. He's seizing power by terrorism and declaring himself the "president" of the Republic of Belarus.
Please note how much the rhetoric of the Kremlin's "Ribbentrop" Lavrov, who is now trying to draw in small and not militarily strong African states, has changed. The Kremlin leader crawled out of his bunker and arrived in Tehran. All this indicates that Russia will do everything to internationalize the conflict, to draw other countries into it.
Therefore, the removal of Lukashenka's regime is one of the stages of the war. From my point of view, it should be one of the initial stages. The Belarusian dictator crossed all the red lines a long time ago. In terms of sanctions, diplomatic steps, severing relations, trade embargoes, and so on - all these steps must be taken. To reduce the front line and secure the border, the Belarusian dictator and his clique, trying to serve the Kremlin, must be removed from power. Moreover, Lukashenka is in power illegally.
But everyone should understand that in terms of international law, Ukraine and Belarus are at war. The use of the territory of Belarus for attacks by missiles, ground, air, and so on is cause and sufficient fact for retaliatory strikes. Therefore, to sober some people up, we should have struck the Russian bases from which missiles fly at Ukraine. One should punish for it. Moreover, the last shelling was carried out from a new base transferred to the Russian Federation. This is another reason to wonder why and how it has been built over the past three years, at least in terms of tactics, understanding of the issue, and so on.
If the fighting between the Ukrainian and Russian Armed Forces stretches over time, this war will spread all over Europe. This is how Putin can save himself. There's a reason for certain statements of the semi-dictator of Hungary, Orban. Similar statements are heard now from the current Serbian president. Their task is to undermine the European community, to bring discord into the EU, using such Kremlin-dependent semi-leaders, similar to Putin and Lukashenka, to spread this conflict as widely as possible, drawing new countries into it.
- If one analyzes the events of the last month when missiles were supplied from Russia to Zyabrovka and other points in Belarus, the situation was predictable. Lukashenka's information spin and rhetoric over the past two weeks suggested that we should expect some act of aggression from the territory of Belarus. The statements of the head of the DPR, Pushilin, about the liberation of allegedly Russian towns, were also widely spread. All of this indicated that something was about to happen. Therefore, this plot does not come as a surprise.
- As for the retaliatory strikes, there is only a moment of the political decision of the Ukrainian government. One should understand that the strategy and tactics of military actions are the prerogative of the command of the Armed Forces. Everything depends on the political decision of the Ukrainian state on when and how to retaliate.
Dictator Lukashenka is at war not only against Ukraine but also against the Belarusian people. The Ukrainian politician and diplomat, former Ambassador of Ukraine to Belarus Roman Bessmertny expressed this opinion in an interview with Charter97.org.
- Three quarters of Belarusians are against this war. This war is being waged by a particular man, parasitizing on the army, Belarusian society, and so on. Ukraine has not attacked Lukashenka and has not shelled Belarus. We have neither initiated the attack nor planned it.
- Why has not there been even a diplomatic response to Lukashenka's actions on the part of Ukraine so far - no severing of relations, no imposition of a trade embargo?
And the situation with Belarus is absolutely clear. Lukashenka has long been dependent on the Kremlin chief, so he will obey all the commands that come from the Kremlin. I do not doubt that Lukashenka will send the Belarusian army to Ukraine. This is the law of the genre. The Belarusian opposition should initiate dialogue with the society in this situation. While working with the Belarusian society, one must explain to the army what must be done not to confront the people. This crazy impostor Lukashenka will do anything.
At the moment, it is obvious that the decision has been taken not to retaliate.
Lukashenka has initiated this war, as he is a servant of the Kremlin. He must be punished.
