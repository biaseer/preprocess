Russian forces are launching offensive operations around Bakhmut, southwest of Avdiivka and southwest of Donetsk, and also conducted unsuccessful offensive operations in the north and northwest of the Kherson region, the ISW added.
This is stated in the report of the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
ISW notes that uch a limited statement of Russian goals sharply contrasts with previously articulated Russian war goals to denazify and demilitarize all of Ukraine. Putins relatively limited statement additionally is incompatible with Russian actions to integrate occupied parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions into the Russian Federation.
Its employees analyze the speech of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Army-2022 forum on August 15.
Russias strategic objectives remain unchanged: the regime change in Kyiv, and securing territorial control over most of Ukraine. However, now the Kremlin is trying to misrepresent its true goals.
Putin omitted mention of territory outside of Donbas while describing the goals of Russias war in Ukraine on August 15. Putin closed his preliminary remarks to the Army-2022 forum on August 15 with the claim that Russian and Donbas forces are doing their duty to fight for Russia, for the peaceful life in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, fulfilling their tasks and liberating the land of Donbas step by step.
