Belarusian Partisans Will Do To Lukashenka What Italian Ones Did To Mussolini

The Cockroach dreadfully stated that 'the units of the armed forces received orders to target, as it is now fashionable to say, decision-making centers in your capitals with all its consequences'.
The homegrown Mussolini needs to justify tomorrow's attacks by the Russian Iskanders on Ukrainian cities from Belarus.
Lukashenka is preparing an informational premise - casus belli - a legal reason for starting a war with Ukraine.
"... three days ago, maybe a little more, they tried to strike at military facilities on the territory of Belarus from Ukraine. But, thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles that were launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine," the Potato Fuhrer said.
The logic is idiotic. Made for idiots. Any sane person understands that Ukraine is struggling to hold Russian aggression in the east and is not at all interested in opening a second front in the north. This is not in the interests of the country, but Ukraine is forced to keep significant forces on the border with Belarus. This forced distraction only plays to Putin's strength.
He understands perfectly well that this is a war. And that the subsequent probable invasion of Ukraine by the Belarusian army is also a war. Thus, he understands that no one will spare him for sure, neither the Belarusian partisans nor ours. They will do to him what the Italian partisans did to the Duce.
By the way, what missiles can the Pantsir shoot down? Except perhaps ground-based and air-based winged ones, which Ukraine simply does not have. This system is useless against the Tochka-U, a certain number of these missiles are still left in Ukraine.
