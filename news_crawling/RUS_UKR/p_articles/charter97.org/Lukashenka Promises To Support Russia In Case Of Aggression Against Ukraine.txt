Earlier, on November 29, at a meeting on military security, Lukashenka also promised to support Russia: I have no information about Russia's planned attack on Ukraine. But if there were such plans, the Belarusian military, including me, would know about it. We would be informed. But I say it again: facts on the table. They understand perfectly well: if they again unleash a war in the Donbas or somewhere on the border with Russia, Belarus will not be left on the sidelines. And it is clear on whose side Belarus will be.
I will never be on the side of the nationalist intoxication that is taking place in Ukraine today, you know. I would do everything to make Ukraine ours. It is ours, Ukraine, our people are there. These are not emotions. These are my firm convictions. If we, God forbid, find ourselves, if Russia is facing aggression from Ukraine, we will be closely linked - economically, legally, politically - with Russia. And legally, this is the main thing, said the usurper.
Lukashenka once again promised to support Russia in the conflict with Ukraine. He stated this in an interview with Russian propagandist Dmitry Kiselev, ria.ru reports.
