At the same time, successful Ukrainian counterattacks near Zaporizhzhia are forcing Russian forces to relocate reinforcements urgently to this weakened section of the front line.
In the coming weeks, the counterattacks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will pose an even greater threat to the Russian occupiers in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia region. This is stated in an analysis by the Institute for the Study of War.
It is noted that recent AFU counterattacks forced the Russians to focus on holding their defensive positions along the southern axis, ISW reports.
ISW analysts predict that local Ukrainian counterattacks will continue to push back Russian forces, especially along the border of Kherson and Mykolayiv regions, and may pose an even greater threat to occupied Kherson in the coming weeks.
The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the enemy is reinforcing air defence systems in Kherson Region, probably in response to continuous successful attacks by Ukrainian aircraft south of Davydov Brod.
ISW analysts believe that the occupiers are likely pulling troops into Zaporizhzhia region to defend against ongoing Ukrainian counterattacks on Melitopol, which could threaten Russian control of the city.
It is noted that the Kremlin continues to consider its invasion of Ukraine as a "special military operation" rather than a war, and is actively discouraging Russian forces with this.
