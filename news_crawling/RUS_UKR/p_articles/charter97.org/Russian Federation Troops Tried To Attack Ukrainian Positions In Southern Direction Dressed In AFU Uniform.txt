A total of 33 occupants and seven units of enemy equipment were destroyed in the southern direction during the day. At the same time, the occupiers are trying to attract residents of the occupied territories to the war on their side.
"A fighting clash between a Ukrainian unit and a specific group of enemy forces has occurred in the northeast of Mykolayiv region, in the direction of Kryvyi Rih. The enemy, supported by two Tiger armoured fighting vehicles under cover of mortar fire, tried to seize an observation post of the Ukrainian military. At the same time, the occupants were wearing AFU military uniforms," the command said.
The South Operational Command reports that Russian occupiers tried to attack Ukrainian positions in the northeast of Mykolayiv Region dressed in the uniform of the AFU.
"The occupation authorities and the Rashist army are trying to force the local residents to cooperate or agree to the occupation. They reportedly intend to mobilise Ukrainians from the occupied territories of Kherson region to fight against Ukraine. This is a gross violation of the Geneva Convention and qualifies as a war crime. But such practices have been inherent to the criminal state since the occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk regions," the command said.
