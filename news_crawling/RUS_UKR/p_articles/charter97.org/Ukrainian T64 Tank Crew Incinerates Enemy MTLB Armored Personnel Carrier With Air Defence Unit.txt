"We destroy the Russian occupants along with their armoured vehicles. The enemy will be eliminated and the Ukrainian land will be completely cleared of enemy invaders," the soldiers assured.
Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have demonstrated another precise strike against the occupier's equipment. The defenders used a T-64 BM tank to hit an enemy multipurpose floating armoured personnel carrier MT-LB.
The relevant video was made public on the Facebook page of the 22nd Separate Motorized Infantry Battalion of the AFU. "The weapon - no matter how cool it is - is operated by brave Ukrainian soldiers who are already in their 177th day of war defending Ukrainian soil from Russian occupying forces," the post reads.
The defenders showed how they hit with a T-64 BM tank an MT-LB with a 23mm ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun, which the enemy believed was securely hidden.
