"This is the real attitude of Russia to Europe," President Zelensky said yesterday about the missile attack during the visit of the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, who visited Odesa on Europe Day.
I understand that this is a port city. But this is not the only reason. This paranoiac hates free people and free cities. Odesa is the brightest symbol of freedom and the free city. The cosmopolitan city in the most beautiful sense of the word.
It's scary what can happen to Odesa. Indeed, this sea pearl especially painfully deceived the monster in its expectations. He certainly expected Russian-speaking Odesa to meet him with open arms. But free people of free cities want to be free regardless of the language they speak. And now that the rat is cornered by its endless self-deceptions and mistakes when the rat doesn't seem to have a plan to get out of the war, it's scary for sure.
It is possible to list infinitely all the reasons for the occupied city of Odesa to be in each Jewish, Ukrainian, and Russian heart, to explain its huge historical and cultural importance.
Yes, Putin treats the entire free world this way, not just Europe. The same way for our values, our common culture and history and our different cultures and histories.
This small, grey, limited creature will never crawl up the Potemkin stairs or the Primorsky Stairs, whoever likes. I wish you courage, beloved city!
