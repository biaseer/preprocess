Well-known politician and mayor of Riga Mrti Stais spoke about this in the program of Studio X97.
- I don't think anyone could imagine that Russia might attack Ukraine or just take away territory. We're also a former Soviet country. Why can't something like "let's see what else is in Latvia, let's check NATO", for example, happen one day? Anything can happen. Many people have asked themselves this question: What will I do on that day? What do I choose: will I be a victim or will I be a fighter? And, of course, a lot of people have decided that they will fight.
- Mr. Mayor, I have read, correct me if I am inaccurate in the wording, that you joined a paramilitary organization in 2014.
- I wasn't the only one. It was a big wave. By the way, the vice mayor of Riga was in the same battalion as me. This, of course, happened after the situation in Ukraine.
- And in the case of Belarus, do you see the risk of repeating the 2014 scenario?
I myself have never been drafted. There is no longer compulsory conscription in Latvia. That's why a lot of people went as volunteers. By the way, by law I'm not subject to mobilization, but one day I won't be mayor anymore, so I have to think about that too.
- You mean, obviously, the annexation of Crimea, Russia's intervention in the Donbass, right? The risk that Russia might come to Latvia as well.
- We have similar situations. Neighbors live, so does the regime, which is not afraid to act by such methods. Georgia, Abkhazia, Ukraine have shown it. Anything can happen, who knows. It is better to be prepared.
