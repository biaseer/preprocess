"The intensity of Russian artillery attacks along the Sloviansk-Bakhmut axis in the coming days may clarify the degree to which the reduction in intensity was due to the operational pause or the result of Ukrainian attacks," the American experts say.
Experts note that there are detected heat anomalies from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System FIRMS remotely sensed data decreased significantly in Donbas starting around July 10.
Ukrainian HIMARS strikes against Russian ammunition depots, logistics elements, and command and control are likely degrading Russian artillery positions.
In particular, such attacks have likely degraded Russian forces ability to sustain high volumes of artillery fire along front lines.
At the same time, the ISW emphasises that this could be evidence of the operational pause taken by the occupiers.
