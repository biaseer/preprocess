The Ukrainian Armed Forces have attacked enemy ammunition depots in temporarily occupied Ilovaysk, Donetsk Region, and Briliovka, Kherson Region.
It is noted that in Ilovaysk, as a result of the work of the Ukrainian military, the "overwhelming majority" of Russians were killed. At the same time, the composition of the fuel and lubricants was "shining loudly and long". Our soldiers have no doubts that it was burnt to the ground.
The AFU Strategic Communications Directorate also informed that before Ilovaysk, Ukrainian defenders hit a warehouse in Briliovka, where Russian ammunition could be heard exploding loudly and for a long time.
