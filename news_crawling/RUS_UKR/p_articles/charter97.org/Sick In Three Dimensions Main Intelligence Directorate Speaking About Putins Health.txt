Representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense Vadym Skybitsky said that Putin is morally and physically sick, and he also shows signs of schizophrenia.
His health is complicated. But he will fight until the end of his days. He won't stop or give up. It is a mistake to think that his health will influence the course of the war, the representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate emphasized.
In early June, a former friend of the President of the Russian Federation and ex-banker Sergei Pugachev said that Putin might have cancer.
He is a sick person in three dimensions: morally, mentally  a schizophrenic  and physically he is also sick. We'll see what prevails, Skybitsky said.
Earlier, a number of experts and media from different countries claimed that Vladimir Putin was sick. In particular, various types of cancer were attributed to the Russian president, as well as schizophrenia, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. At the end of May, information appeared that Putin had had a surgery.
Vadym Skybitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, spoke about this in an interview with RBC-Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is morally and physically sick. In addition, he has symptoms of schizophrenia.
