Today, March 17, Ukrainian MP Serhiy Taruta said the Mariupol Drama Theatre bomb shelter had withstood the Russian fascists' airstrike and the people who had been there had survived. This was subsequently confirmed by Ombudsman Lyudmyla Denysova.
As many as 130 people have been saved from under the rubble of the Mariupol Drama Theatre. A Russian plane dropped a bomb on it yesterday. The work continues.
"The good news we need so badly. The bomb shelter under the Mariupol Drama Theatre has survived. About 130 residents have already been rescued. The rubble is being dismantled. It's a real miracle," she wrote.
On 16 March, a Russian plane dropped a bomb on the Drama Theatre building in Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians were hiding there. Rubble blocked the entrance to the bomb shelter and there was no information about casualties due to the ongoing shelling.
