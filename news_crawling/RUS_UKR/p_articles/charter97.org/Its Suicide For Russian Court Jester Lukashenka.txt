The number of that territorial defense or citizens of Ukraine in general who are ready to defend their villages and cities with weapons, pitchforks, knives in their hands is many times more than the combat-ready Belarusian army.
Ukrainian political scientist Maxim Dzhihun expressed the opinion that Lukashenka is frightened by the defeats of the Russian military in Ukraine. He expressed this opinion in an article for the 24tv.ua web publisher.
We will return our territorial integrity as a result. We will recapture the Kherson region, we will recapture the Luhansk region, the Donetsk region, the Kharkiv region. They have no chance of success.
It's a suicide for russian court jester Lukashenka I am convinced that he will not take this step, at least now. The action is possible if both Lukashenka and Putin finally go crazy. However, I think that this will not bring radical changes on the battlefield, perhaps some local ones.
 Lukashenka and the Belarussian military have already seen the experience of Russians and their participation in this war. They also see that Russians are returning home in black plastic bags and disassembled. Therefore, they are well aware that the soldier will not return home having entered the territory of the Volyn or Zhytomyr regions.
