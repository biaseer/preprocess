"The Belarusian command is making up replies to the Russians and to their own bosses that morale is low, we cant. Its not low, its just that Belarusians are smart people, and they make a rational choice, he said.
"The 103rd Vitsebsk airborne brigade is the most combat-ready. It is located on the borders with Ukraine, and no one there wants to take part in the war, from a private to an officer. Belarusians are not cowards. They simply soberly consider: why should they die and quarrel completely with their neighbors, whom they consider almost fraternal people, for the whim of a bald Kremlin dwarf?" noted Arestovich.
According to him, if the Belarusian army nevertheless receives an order to fight, they will cross the border, but will not fight or will fight in a limited way, or even go over to the Ukrainian side and take a neutral position.
"Even if they really go into battle, they will put up 5 battalions of a tactical group. This is practically nothing, given the modern scale," the advisor to the head of the OP emphasized.
Oleksiy Arestovich, advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said that the Belarusian army refuses to take part in the war between Russia and Ukraine because of the principled position of the Belarusians.
The Belarusian commanders are making up some excuses to the Russians and their own bosses.
Arestovich added that the number of the Belarusian army is 45 thousand people, out of this number, according to the most optimistic estimates, no more than 17 thousand are combat-ready. But really combat-ready are 5-7 thousand soldiers.
