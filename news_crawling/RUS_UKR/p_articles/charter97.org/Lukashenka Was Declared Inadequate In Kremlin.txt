At Putin's conference, where they discussed everything from torture to NATO, Ukraine and Santa Claus, a single remark was said about Belarus, reports the CYNIC telegram channel.
"It's about synchronizing tax and customs legislation. Those are the basic things. It's been a long and complicated process of coordinating positions."
Both the "Accountant" and the "Collector" the latter also known as the "Mortician" had an important function - access to President Putin's administration. Since Moscow's foreign policy is determined not by the Foreign Ministry, but by the Presidential Administration, this is a serious bonus in terms of influence. And it is this bonus in this case that suggests that the stakes have risen - they want to start controlling Lukashenka on a permanent basis.
Why is this important? Before any "victory" on the foreign front, the public must be prepared to welcome the epochal event. I mean, the people of Russia didn't know that they wanted Crimea, but beforehand they were told that the occupation of Crimea was a victory, then Crimea was annexed... And then the two links came together, and it was a victory. It does not follow from this "summing up" that the plans for Belarus are particularly extensive, but it does follow from this summing up that there is practically zero trust to Lukashenka.
The Belarusian side has not written anything about Mr. Gryzlov. He is a wolf, a predator and a rodent of the highest caliber, but he is not so young as to "play hard". We know well the case of the active "Accountant," who was pushed into a shuffle and sent to Moscow.
Different people were described in different ways. Zelensky received his traditional for the president of Ukraine "Nazi" status, but Lukashenka was declared inadequate and that was the end of the discussion.
