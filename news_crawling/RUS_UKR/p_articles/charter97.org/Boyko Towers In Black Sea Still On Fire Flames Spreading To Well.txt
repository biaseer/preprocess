Important to note, the Russian Federation seized drilling platforms 100 km from Odesa and 150 km from the Crimea back in 2014. The invaders also used them to monitor the surface situation with the help of electronic intelligence.
The fire on the tower does not seem to subside, they tried to approach it by ship, but in vain. The fire has spread to the well, and attempts to extinguish it continue, Kovitidi said.
Sergei Aksyonov, a Russian protege in the Crimea, was one of the first to announce the attack on Chornomorneftegaz drilling towers. He claims there have been wounded and missing people as a result of the shelling.
The fire at the Russia-seized Chornomorneftegaz drilling rig systems the Boyko towers, the capacities of which are used by the occupiers in Crimea, has not yet been eliminated.
Also, seven people who worked at the drilling rig systems have not yet been found.
Senator from the Crimea Olga Kovitidi has reported this to the RIA Novosti propaganda resource.
