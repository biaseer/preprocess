"I think it makes no sense to evaluate every manifestation of the stream of consciousness regularly carried out on various media platforms by Aliaksandr Lukashenka. We will evaluate his actions. If Belarus really recognizes Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea, it will cause an irreparable blow to Ukrainian-Belarusian relations," the Ukrainian foreign minister said.
He also added that in this case Ukraine "will act to the max," and Crimea is not an issue in which Ukraine "allows itself to abstain".
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has commented on Lukashenka's statements about "de jure and de facto Russian" Crimea to Ukrinform at the NATO Foreign Ministers Summit in Riga.
On November 30, Lukashenka said in an interview with Dmitry Kiselev that he recognizes Crimea as a Russian peninsula "de jure and de facto".
