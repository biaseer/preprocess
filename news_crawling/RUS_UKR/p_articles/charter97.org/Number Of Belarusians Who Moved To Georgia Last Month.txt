There are also differences in the demographics of those who arrived in March. Among Belarusians and Russians, men made up about 60 of adults, while only 35 among Ukrainians. Among male Russians and Belarusians, children under 18 make up only 10, while there are 39 among Ukrainians.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country did not provide statistics on the purposes of entry into the country and the reasons for refusal of entry. However, according to the Institute for the Development of Freedom of Information, the reason for the explosive growth in the number of Russians and Belarusians who left for Georgia was the Russian-Ukrainian war, political repressions, and the desire to avoid sanctions.
In March 2022, almost 20,000 citizens of Belarus came to Georgia, most of them stayed there. The Tbilisi Institute for the Development of Freedom of Information IDFI analyzed the border crossing statistics.
As of the end of March, 31,231 citizens of Russia and Belarus remained in Georgia. According to experts, it is "a serious problem in terms of the security of the country".
"The IDFI believes that the growing trend of Russian citizens and its allies staying in the country poses a significant challenge from the point of view of state security, which requires the adoption of appropriate measures to reduce such risks. In such a situation, effective control over border points and preventing entry into the country of persons representing a danger is of particular importance, the Institute noted.
For comparison, during the same period, 43,152 citizens of Russia and 16,669 citizens of Ukraine arrived in Georgia, while 17,201 Russians and 8,151 citizens of Ukraine remained. The number of entry bans for people from these countries is higher than for Belarusians: 340 Russians 0.75 and 65 Ukrainians 0.38 were refused at the Georgian border.
19,898 Belarusians entered Georgia in March. The majority arrived via the airport in Tbilisi 53. Only 16 citizens of our country, or 0.08, were refused entry. Part of the Belarussians then left, but 14,030 people remained in Georgia at the end of March. Whereas in March 2019 before the pandemic, protests and war, the number of people who entered and left was approximately equal, and the number of Belarusians who arrived was 555 less.
