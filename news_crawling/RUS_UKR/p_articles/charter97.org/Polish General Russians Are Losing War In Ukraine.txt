The Polish general believes that so far there are no visible forces that could support the Russian army and allow it to go on the offensive.
General Waldemar Skrzypczak believes that the Ukrainians have not yet shown their full military potential, and have reserves that can be used at any time. He pointed, in particular, to the international brigades of volunteers and the Ukrainians who returned to the country. According to the general, they could fill in the gaps on the battlefield and create new units.
According to General Skrzypczak, the wounded and exhausted Russians are deprived of operational reserves. The Ukrainians will hit them in those places where the Russians are weakest, where conscripts are serving: The Russian army is unable to carry out tasks, achieve operational goals, as it stopped on the second day of the war and it took another two days to recover. There is a competition in who will get the advantage first, and the Ukrainians, who are gathering their operational reserves, are closer to this.
Former commander of the Polish Ground Forces, General Waldemar Skrzypczak, believes that the Russians are currently losing the war in Ukraine, Polskie Radio reports.
Waldemar Skrzypczak explained that military activity in Ukraine has clearly decreased, and both sides have switched to defensive actions, conducting local counteroffensive and attempted attacks.
According to him, the possible mobilization of reservists at first will not be effective, since they do not have the appropriate combat skills. Such troops could reach combat readiness only after 1.5 months.
In his opinion, the Ukrainians have the potential and reserves, thanks to which they can oust the Russians from their territory, for example, north of Kyiv and in the Kherson region.
