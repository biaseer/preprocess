Ukraine has been planning a major offensive to retake large areas of the south, particularly around Kherson, for several months. Herein, the AFU will mostly tend to attritional strategy, pushing Russia on a broad front, trying to force Russian morale to break and inflict casualties.
On August 29, the Ukrainian military began fighting for Kherson. At the same time, the Armed Forces of Ukraine recaptured four villages in the south from Russian occupation.
Bronk says he expects Ukraine to continue with strikes using Himars as they're proving so successful at cutting off Russian supply lines.
There have been various reports of waning energy within Russia's military since the beginning of the war, but Moscow has repeatedly denied this.
Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at Royal United Services Institute RUSI, has said this, BBC reports.
Russia has had time to move large amounts of forces from the Donbas region down towards Kherson in the last month and a half. But there's no telling what the morale status is of those troops, he noted.
