The Russian military not only fired at the communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region but also for the sake of a propaganda "picture" strike at the settlements temporarily occupied by them.
Vilkul also noted that on Monday, May 30, the occupiers fired on the Zelenodolsk and Apostolove communities of the Kryvyi Rih region. Fortunately, nobody was injured.
Osokorivka, Novovorontsovka and other settlements were also under bombardment. At the same time, Vilkul stressed that the situation in Kryvyi Rih and the region is fully controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Military Administration.
"Having neither tactical nor strategic success, the enemy continues dirty shelling along the entire contact line," he said.
