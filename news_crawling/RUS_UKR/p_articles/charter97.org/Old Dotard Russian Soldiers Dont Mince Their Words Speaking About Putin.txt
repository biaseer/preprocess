The official Telegram channel of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine writes about it
Ukraine's intelligence service has intercepted another conversation of an occupant. This time, a Russian military officer shared his impressions of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin.
"Today Putin Russian president - ed. has paid tribute at the parade to those killed in Odessa in 2014. Is he adequate at all, or not? His speech is some kind of a shit show. What does Suvorov, Monomakh and the Great Patriotic War have to do with it?" said the acquaintance of a Russian soldier.
The occupant was surprised that last year's parade was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, however, conditions of war did not prevent the Kremlin from organising a "celebration" this year.
