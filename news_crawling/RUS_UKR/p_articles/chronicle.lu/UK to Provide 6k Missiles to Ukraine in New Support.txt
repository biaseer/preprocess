Thursday's NATO summit in Brussels is expected to unlock additional aid for Kyiv including equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce the new package of support on Thursday 24 March 2022 at the NATO and G7 leaders' meetings while also signalling a willingness to bolster Ukraine's defence capabilities further, his office said on Wednesday.
"The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight," PM Johnson said.
LONDON Reuters - Britain will provide Ukraine with about 6,000 new defensive missiles and almost 30 million to support the BBC's coverage in the region and pay Ukrainian soldiers and pilots.
Britain said with the new commitment it will have provided up to 10,000 missiles and that the additional funds come on top of 400 million committed in humanitarian and economic aid.
As part of the package, the UK will provide 6,000 missiles and 25 million in financial backing for the Ukrainian military. It will also provide 4.1 million for the BBC World Service to help support its Ukrainian and Russian language services, and tackle disinformation.
"One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world."
