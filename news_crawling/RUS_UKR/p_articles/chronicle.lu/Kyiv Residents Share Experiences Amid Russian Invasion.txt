The story of Olga and her neighbours is just one of many similar experiences shared by those living in Ukraine at present.
Beyond the shelter, people have begun stockpiling groceries and queues are long outside supermarkets and banks in Kyiv, according to Olga.
One resident, a woman named Olga, explained that she and her neighbours, who live near KyivZhuliany Airport, have had to hide themselves in a shelter, i.e. a classroom in a nearby school. "The underground floor is a shelter and a classroom at the same time", she said.Among them are eight children.
In light of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chronicle.lu reached out to residents of Kyiv to learn about their experiences in the Ukrainian capital during these challenging times.
Olga added that the father of one of the children, a young girl, left the shelter"to protect the country". So as not to discourage his daughter, however, he told her he was going on a business trip.
"We are all scared and stressed", Olga said, referring to the growing number of people taking refuge in this school-turned-shelter.
