"Russiais ready to help find options for the unhindered export of grain, including the export of Ukrainian grain from the Black Sea ports," Putin told Macron and Scholz, the Kremlin said.
"An increase in the supply ofRussian fertilisers and agricultural products will also help reduce tensions on the global food market, which, of course, will require the removal of the relevant sanctions."
Talks betweenRussian and Ukrainian delegations have been held both in person and via video-link since theRussian military offensive but have recently ground to a halt.
The Kremlin chief also warned French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz against ramping up arms supplies to Ukraine, saying they could further destabilise the situation in the pro-Western country.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday told the leaders of France and Germany Moscow was "ready" to look for ways to ship grain stuck in Ukrainian ports but demanded the West lift sanctions.
Russia's offensive in Ukraine and Western sanctions have disrupted supplies of fertiliser, wheat and other commodities from the two countries, fuelling concerns about the risk of hunger around the world.
The West has accused Putin of using hunger as a weapon in Moscow's offensive against Ukraine.
