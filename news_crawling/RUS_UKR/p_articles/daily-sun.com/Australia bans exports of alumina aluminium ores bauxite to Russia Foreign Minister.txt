"Russia relies on Australia for nearly 20 of its alumina needs," the Minister said noting that the government "will work closely with exporters and peak bodies that will be affected by the ban to find new and expand existing markets."
The Australian authorities will send at least 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to Ukraine to ensure the country's energy security, Payne announced.
The Australian government imposes a ban on the export of alumina, aluminum ores and bauxite to Russia, Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Senator Marise Payne announced on Sunday.
According to her, Australian coal, which is supplied by the country's largest coal mining company Whitehaven Coal, "will help keep the countrys coal-fired power generators operating and supplying electricity to countrys power grid, supporting the Ukrainian people by keeping lights on, homes heated, and factories running at this very difficult time."
"Whitehaven Coal has quickly arranged a shipment, and the Government is now working with Whitehaven and the Ukrainian and Polish Governments to deliver the supplies at the earliest available opportunity," she said.
"The Government has overnight imposed an immediate ban on Australian exports of alumina and aluminium ores and bauxite to Russia, which will limit its capacity to produce aluminium - a critical export for Russia," Payne said.
"Australia will support Ukraines energy security by donating at least 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal. This follows a request for assistance from the Government of Ukraine, supported by the Government of Poland, and discussions with other European partners," Payne said.
