China, which is already the worlds second superpower, will compete with the West not just for power but against our system, our way of governing and living, the Labour politician warned.
In order to stay relevant in the new environment, the West needs to develop a common strategy, pursued with coordination, commitment and competence, with higher defense spending to maintain military superiority while expanding so-called soft power by building ties with developing countries, Blair concluded.

Beijing will not be alone. It will have allies. Russia now for sure. Possibly Iran.
It is the first time in modern history that the East can be on equal terms with the West, he added.
We are coming to the end of Western political and economic dominance. The world is going to be at least bi-polar and possibly multi-polar, he predicted.
