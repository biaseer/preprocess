"Imagine that Ukraine is a Nato member and a military operation to regain Crimea begins," the Russian leader said. "What - are we going to fight with Nato? Has anyone thought about this? It seems like they haven't."
Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Tuesday that a Russian invasion would "not be a war between Ukraine and Russia - this would be a war in Europe, a full-scale one".
He suggested that if Ukraine were granted its wish to join Nato, it could drag the other members into a war with Russia.
Rivalry between Russia and the US, which still possess the world's biggest nuclear arsenals, dates back to the Cold War 1947-89. Ukraine was then a crucial part of the communist Soviet Union, second only to Russia.
In his first significant comments on the crisis in several weeks, he said America's goal was to use a confrontation as a pretext to impose more sanctions on Russia.
But Russia denies Western accusations that it is planning an invasion, nearly eight years after it annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backed a bloody rebellion in the eastern Donbas region.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has accused the US of trying to draw his country into a war in Ukraine.
Russia has in recent weeks moved about 100,000 troops - equipped with everything from tanks and artillery to ammunition and air power - to Ukraine's border.
Mr Putin said the US had ignored Moscow's concerns in its response to Russian demands for legally binding security guarantees, including a block on Nato's further expansion to the east.
Moscow in turn accuses the Ukrainian government of failing to implement an international deal to restore peace to the east, where at least 14,000 people have been killed and Russian-backed rebels control swathes of territory.
