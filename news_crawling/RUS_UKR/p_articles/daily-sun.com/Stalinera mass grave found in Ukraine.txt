KIEV: The remains of thousands of people believed to be victims of Stalins Terror have been discovered in Ukraines southern city of Odessa, local authorities said on Wednesday, reports AFP.
According to estimates made by Ukrainian historians, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians were imprisoned or executed in Gulag camps during the Stalinist repressions in the 1930s.
These documents will never be handed over to us under the current government in Russia, he said.
The bones of between 5,000 to 8,000 people were found in over two dozen graves close to Odessas airport, making it one of the largest mass graves unearthed in Ukraine so far.
But the historian said that the executions date back to 1937-39, the time known as Stalins Great Terror.
The remains were discovered after exploratory works started as part of plans to expand the airports territory, he said.
One of the best-known execution sites is the forest near the village of Bykivnia on the outskirts of Kiev, where tens of thousands of victims were buried in 1937-1941.
Ties between the ex-Soviet countries have deteriorated sharply since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and threw its weight behind armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Millions of Ukrainians also died in the great famine of 1932-1933, which Ukraine regards as a genocide orchestrated by Stalin.
Some mass graves had already been unearthed in the area in previous years, he added.
The prisoners nationalities and the crimes for which they were sentenced to die remain unknown.
