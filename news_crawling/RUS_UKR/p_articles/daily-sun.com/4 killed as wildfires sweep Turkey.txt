Wildfires have broken out elsewhere in the region, with more than 40 in Greece in the last 24 hours, fanned by winds and soaring temperatures, authorities said.
ANKARA: The death toll from wildfires on Turkeys southern coast has risen to four and firefighters were battling blazes for a third day on Friday after the evacuation of dozens of villages and some hotels, reports Reuters.
Forestry minister Bekir Pakdemirli said fires raged on in six provinces and officials promised to bring to account anyone found responsible for starting them.
Pakdemirli said fires were still blazing in the Mediterranean resort region of Antalya and the Aegean resort province of Mugla.
On Tuesday, a blaze tore through a pine forest north of Athens, damaging more than a dozen homes before it was brought under control. Fires also burned large swathes of pine forest in the mountainous north of Lebanon this week, killing at least one firefighter and forcing some residents to flee.
More than 70 wildfires have broken out this week in provinces on Turkeys Aegean and Mediterranean coasts as well as inland areas, president Tayyip Erdogan said, adding that 14 were still burning.
Istanbul governors office banned entry to forest areas until the end of August as a precaution against fires.
Villages and some hotels have been evacuated in tourist areas and television footage has shown people fleeing across fields as fires closed in on their homes.
Erdogan said at least five planes, 45 helicopters, drones, and 1,080 firefighting vehicles were involved in firefighting efforts at 1,140 sites.
One person was found dead on Thursday in Muglas Marmaris area, 290 km west of Manavgat. The blaze continued in Marmaris but residential areas were not at risk, Pakdemirli said.
