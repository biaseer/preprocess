The West has accused Putin of using hunger as a weapon in Moscows offensive against Ukraine.
An increase in the supply of Russian fertilisers and agricultural products will also help reduce tensions on the global food market, which, of course, will require the removal of the relevant sanctions.
Russias offensive in Ukraine and Western sanctions have disrupted supplies of fertiliser, wheat and other commodities from the two countries, fuelling concerns about the risk of hunger around the world.
The Kremlin chief also warned French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz against ramping up arms supplies to Ukraine, saying they could further destabilise the situation in the pro-Western country. Putin said the difficulties in supplying grain to world markets were the result of erroneous economic and financial policies of Western countries.
MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday told the leaders of France and Germany Moscow was ready to look for ways to ship grain stuck in Ukrainian ports but demanded the West lift sanctions, reports AFP.
