India's overall exports Merchandise and Services touched an all-time high of USD 669.65 Billion in April-March 2021-22, jumping by 34.50 per cent over the same period last year. For the last month, March 2022, India's exports grew by 15.51 per cent in March 2022 to USD 64.75 Billion over the same period last year. Addressing a press conference here today, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles, Piyush Goyal said India has achieved this exports high despite the slowdown in the economy worldwide due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent geopolitical developments in Europe. "Services sector has achieved the all-time high despite Services like Tourism, Aviation and Hospitality industry being severely affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic," he said. Goyal said India has been able to exceed the overall exports target of $ 650 Billion due to the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that we turn India into an export focussed economy. "The PM himself conducted meetings with India's 180 missions abroad. Hectic parleys were held with the Export Promotion Councils and then the bar was set high, and yet doable," he said. Goyal said if we have to make India a developed nation, we will have to increase our international engagement. The government has struck vital trade deals with the UAE and Australia towards this end, he said, adding more FTAs and Comprehensive Trade Agreements are in the works with the EU, UK, Canada and Israel. "Starting from 'whole of the Government' approach, today 'Whole of the Nation' has joined hands to make India emerge as a trusted partner at the international level, dedicating itself to turn into an economy that provides quality goods and services to the world," he said.
