As the world keeps a close watch on Russian troops along the Ukrainian border, families within the country are concerned about what could happen next.
According to the White House, President Joe Biden said the United States would respond quickly and decisively, together with its allies and partners, to any further Russian aggression.
"I'm scared that it might be an attempt to reconsider the balance between East and West," said Lyudmyla Tsykalova.
Her father still lives there and he's told her life there has been tense in recent weeks.
On top of that, he said the cost of food has doubled in the last month.
Tsykalova said that while Russia has attempted to divide Americans politically, the United States and its allies need to stand up and work together to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"It is very important for Americans to come together so that Russia doesn't gain the powers that it's trying to attain," she said. "Because it is not about Ukraine potentially coming tonight or it is not about gaining control by Russia by some more territories in Ukraine. I think the battle is much wider."
