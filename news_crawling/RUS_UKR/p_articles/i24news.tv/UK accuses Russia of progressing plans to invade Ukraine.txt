The British foreign ministry declined to provide evidence that would back up its accusations, which come amid high tensions between Russia and the West over their massing of troops near its border with Ukraine.
Russias foreign ministry dismissed Britains comments as disinformation, accusing Britain and NATO of escalating tensions.
"The Kremlin knows a military incursion would be a massive strategic mistake  the United Kingdom and our partners would impose a severe cost on Russia."
Britain on Saturday accused the Kremlin of trying to install a pro-Russia leader in Ukraine and said Russian intelligence officers were in contact with former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for an invasion.
However, the British office said it had information that Russia was considering former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevhen Murayev as a potential candidate to head a pro-Russian government.
A foreign ministry source said the details of the statement and accusations were only declassified after careful consideration to deter Russian aggression.
"We will not tolerate Kremlin plot to install pro-Russian leadership in Ukraine," British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Twitter.
Calls to Western allies to bolster Ukraines defense capabilities have seen the United States, Britain, and Baltic states agree to send weapons to Kyiv, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.
In a separate development earlier on Saturday, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned Germany for its refusal to supply weapons to Kyiv, urging Berlin to stop "undermining unity" and "encouraging Vladimir Putin.
"We urge the Foreign Office to cease these provocative activities, stop spreading nonsense" the ministry said on Facebook.
