I would like to bring to your attention disturbing information recently obtained by the United States that indicates that human rights violations and abuses in the aftermath of a further invasion are being planned, Crocker wrote in the letter addressed to Michelle Bachelet Jeria, the UN's high commissioner for human rights.
In the letter, Bathsheba Crocker, the US ambassador to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva, warns of "widespread human suffering" if Russia decided to invade Ukraine.
These acts, which in past Russian operations have included targeted killings, kidnappingsforced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture, would likely target those who oppose Russian actions."
Also on Sunday, the White House announced that a meeting was agreed to "in principle" between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin unless there is an invasion.
The United States has sent a letter to the United Nations claiming that Russia is compiling a list of Ukrainians "to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation," The Washington Post reports.
