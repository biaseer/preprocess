Schools in Russia are now required to teach special social studies classes which reframe the Ukraine war as a special peacekeeping operation with a Kremlin-friendly retelling of the events there.
The OVD-Info group said that by around 2:20 pm Moscow time Sunday, 1,103 people were detained across 35 cities after participating in anti-war rallies.
Sundays count brings the total number of demonstrators detained to 9,472 since February 24, when President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine to carry out a "special operation."
Russia is embarking on a large-scale censorship and revisionism campaign in order to stifle public unrest over the war in Ukraine as protests continue across the country.
Additionally, students' families are being provided with letters that urge parents to supervise their childrens social media activities should they be coerced into unsafe anti-war protests.
The notice warns that the anti-war movement could also expose young social media users to suicide flash mobs, detailed instructions on gender reassignment, and promotion of same-sex relationships, according to Al Jazeera.
More than 1,100 people in cities across Russia were detained at protests Sunday against Moscow's military operation in Ukraine, a protest monitor said, more than one week after the assault began.
