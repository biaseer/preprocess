Russia calls its actions a special military operation to demilitarize neo-Nazis in Ukraine, a narrative considered by the West as a baseless pretext for war.
"The meetings continue, and, I am informed, the positions during the negotiations, already sound more realistic, Zelensky said in a video address on Wednesday.
But time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine.
While Moscow has not captured any of Ukraines 10 biggest cities during its three-week-long incursion, Russian airstrikes and artillery are exacting a heavy price on civilians, with three million refugees already expelled from the country.
Ukrainian officials raised hopes that the war could possibly end by May, though, saying Moscow could be coming to terms with its failure to impose a new government and overrun troops.
Hinting at a possible compromise, the Ukrainian leader said earlier that he was prepared to accept security guarantees from the West that stop short of joining NATO, a long-time goal of the eastern European state.
Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that peace talks were sounding more realistic, but that time was still needed.
'The very fact that the talks are continuing is probably positive' says Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov
Moscow considers any possibility of Ukraine's membership in the Western alliance as a threat and demands guarantees that it will never join.
"The work is difficult, and in the current situation the very fact that the talks are continuing is probably positive."
On Tuesday airstrikes killed at least four people in the capital, Kyiv, Al Jazeera reported.
