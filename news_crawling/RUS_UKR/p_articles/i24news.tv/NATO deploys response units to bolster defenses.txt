Stoltenberg said that NATO was deploying elements of its rapid response force, which is made up of land, air, maritime and special operations forces, on allied territory.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday that the alliance was deploying parts of its combat-ready response force and would continue to send weapons to Ukraine, including air defenses.
On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed his forces on Ukraine and on Friday Moscow's troops approached capital Kyiv.
He said some of the 30 allies announced the type of weapons that they would supply Ukraine, including air defenses, without giving details. "Allies are very committed to continue to provide support," he said.
"We see rhetoric, the messages, which is strongly indicating that the aim is to remove the democratically-elected government in Kyiv," he told a news conference following a virtual meeting of NATO leaders.
