The night of his trip, Macron told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper: "The geopolitical objective of Russia today is clearly not Ukraine, but to clarify the rules of cohabitation with NATO and the EU."
"I see how much efforts the current leadership of France and the president personally is applying to solve the crisis related to providing equal security in Europe for a serious historical perspective," Putin said.
Macron positioned himself as a potential mediator on the crisis with Russia and Ukraine, with Paris voicing skepticism about predictions by Washington that a Russian assault is imminent.

On his arrival, Macron told reporters he was "reasonably optimistic, but I don't believe in spontaneous miracles."
Putin responded, saying that Russia and France shared "a common concern about what is happening in the security sphere in Europe."
He told Putin he was seeking a "useful" response that "allows us to avoid war and to build bricks of trust, stability, visibility," Reuters reported.
French President Emmanuel Macron told Vladimir Putin at the start of talks in the Kremlin on Monday that he aimed to avoid war and build trust.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ahead of the talks: "The situation is too complex to expect decisive breakthroughs in the course of one meeting," according to Reuters.
