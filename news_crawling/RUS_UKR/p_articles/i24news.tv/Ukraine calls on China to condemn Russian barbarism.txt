The White House said that Biden described to Xi "the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians."
Ukraine on Saturday called on China to join the West in condemning "Russian barbarism," after the US warned Beijing of consequences if it backed Moscow's attack on the country.
China is staying out of the international outcry against Russia's actions in Ukraine, refusing to condemn President Vladimir Putin's invasion.
"China can be the global security systems important element if it makes a right decision to support the civilized countries coalition and condemn Russian barbarism," presidential aide Mikhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter.
US President Joe Biden told Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a call Friday that any backing for Russia in its war in Ukraine would be costly.
