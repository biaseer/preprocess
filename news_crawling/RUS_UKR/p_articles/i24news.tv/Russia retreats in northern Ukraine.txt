He said that, while Russian forces appeared to be pulling back from Kyiv, Irpin and Chernigiv, their aim was to "control a vast stretch of occupied territory and set up there in a powerful way."
President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian invasion on February 24, setting off a war in which over 20,000 people were killed so far, according to Ukrainian estimates.
"Russia is prioritizing a different tactic: falling back on the east and south," Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said on social media.
Ukraine on Saturday said Russian forces were making a "rapid retreat" from northern areas around the capital Kyiv and the city of Chernigiv.
Russian forces now appear to be focusing attacks in the east and south, a day after thousands of people from Mariupol and surrounding Russian-held areas escaped in a convoy of buses and private cars.
