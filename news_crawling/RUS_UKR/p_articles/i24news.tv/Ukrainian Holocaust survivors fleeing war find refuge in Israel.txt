I have lived through two tragedies, Valerie Bendersky, an 85-year old man who fled Ukraine for the central Israeli city Petah Tikva, said.
I said to myself: 'Oh my God, what a nightmare! Here we go again with the war, bombings, evacuation, leaving your home behind, not being sure if youll stay alive or not'," she said.
Nearly 300 Ukrainian Holocaust survivors who fled their war-torn country after Russias invasion are now sheltering in Israel.
'I was fleeing from Hitler then, now I have fled from Putin. Naturally, it is hard'
Dova Govergeviz, a 100-year-old survivor who hails from Kyiv, fled the city for a second time during Russias invasion.
Bendersky expressed hope that the invading Russian troops would be pushed back by defending forces and driven out of Ukraine, and asked Can't they let us live out our lives peacefully?
Back then, we knew that we had an enemy - Hitler. Hitler and Germany had attacked our country. But now it turns out to be that were fighting against the country that we used to call our 'elder brother'," Govergeviz said.
I was fleeing from Hitler then, now I have fled from Putin. Naturally, it is hard.
The man explained that he fled his former residence in Kharkiv in a rush, and that he did not have time to collect his belongings when the city came under Russian fire.
For a number of those who sought refuge in the country, the conflict in Ukraine evokes memories of the persecution they suffered during the Nazi genocide.
