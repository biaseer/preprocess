"As a result of periodic shelling, the infrastructure of the station has been damaged, there are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high," Energoatom said on Telegram.
The Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian troops since early March.
The agency said that as of midday Saturday the plant "operates with the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards."
Russia's defense ministry issued a counter-claim that Ukraine's troops were responsible for a salvo of 17 shells landing on the site.
Russia's defense ministry said Ukrainian forces "shelled the territory of the station three times" from the town of Marganets across the Dnipro River.
On Saturday its Ukraine operator Energoatom said Russian troops "repeatedly shelled" it over the past day.
Ukraine and Russia traded fresh accusations of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Saturday, as its operator warned of a radioactive leak risk at the atomic facility.
Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused each other of rocket attacks in the vicinity of the plant -- Europe's largest -- located in the city of Energodar.
