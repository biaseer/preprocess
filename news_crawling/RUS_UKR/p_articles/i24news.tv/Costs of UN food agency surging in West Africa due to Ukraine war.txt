Acute hunger quadrupled in West Africa over the past three years, with 43 million people expected to face acute food insecurity by June.

Operational costs of the United Nations World Food Program WFP will surge by $136 million in West Africa this year due to the global rise in food and fuel prices driven by the war in Ukraine.
Several aid agencies have raised concerns about the Ukraine war diverting funds from other crises.
The additional costs will hamper attempts to relieve a spiraling food crisis in the region fueled by conflict, drought, Covid-linked border closures, and record-high food prices.
