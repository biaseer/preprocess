Three people died, including a little girl, the municipality said on Telegram. The previous report published the day before by the authorities reported 17 people wounded.
Russia's foreign ministry did not deny the attack but accused Ukrainian "nationalist battalions" of using the hospital to set up firing positions after moving out staff and patients.
The White House slammed the "barbaric" use of force against civilians, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the attack "depraved."
Video shared from the site by rescue workers showed a scene of complete devastation, with the wounded being evacuated, some on stretchers, past charred and burning carcasses of cars and a massive crater by the building.
Inside, debris, shattered glass and splintered wood littered corridors, administrative offices and bedrooms, with mattresses thrown from their frames.
Three people were killed, including a child, as a result of Wednesday's Russian air strike on a maternity and children's hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, officials said Thursday.
International leaders and Ukraine condemned the bombing, accusing Moscow of a "barbaric" attack on the besieged city.
Ukrainian President Volodomor Zelensky shared video footage showing massive destruction at the recently refurbished hospital in the southern port city, condemning the attack as a "war crime."
A fourth person was killed in a raid on Thursday morning, the municipality added in a separate statement.
"Russian troops are deliberately and ruthlessly destroying the civilian population of Mariupol," accused the municipality which had reported the day before more than 1,200 local inhabitants killed in nine days of the Russian siege of the city.
