"The enemy has increased the number of troops in the Belgorod region by transferring and concentrating additional units," the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in its daily morning update, according to Reuters.
In March, the Russian army said it was focusing on the two Donbas regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, where pro-Russian rebels have been active since 2014.
Ukraine and the West call the invasion, now in its third month, an unjustified war of aggression.
Russia deployed Iskander-M mobile battlefield missile launchers within 40 miles of the Ukrainian border, General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Sunday.
On Friday, Russian Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekaev was quoted as saying that "one of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine," adding this would provide "a land corridor to Crimea," the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
The Iskander, a mobile ballistic missile system codenamed SS-26 Stone by NATO, replaced the Soviet Scud missile. Its two guided missiles have a range of up to 300 miles and can carry conventional or nuclear warheads.
"According to available information, Iskander-M launchers have been deployed 60 km from the border with Ukraine," it said, without providing more detail on the location of the systems.
