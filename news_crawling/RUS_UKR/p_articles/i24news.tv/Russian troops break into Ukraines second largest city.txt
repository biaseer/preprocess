Emergency services located in the city reported that a residential building was struck and suffered heavy damage during the incident.
"Control over Kharkiv is completely ours! The armed forces, the police, and the defense forces are working, and the city is being completely cleansed of the enemy," the official said, according to Reuters.
He called on the world to take action against Russia in response to its invasion, and called Moscows armed forces war criminals.
On Saturday, Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba announced on Twitter that a residential apartment building in the capital city was struck by a missile.
While fighting raged in Kharkiv, the city administration in Kyiv - approximately 250 miles to the west - said that the capital remained completely under the control of Ukrainian forces despite clashes with "sabotage groups."
Russian troops entered Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv on Sunday, the head of the regional administration said on the fourth day of Moscow's invasion of the pro-Western country.
Later, the regional governor announced that Ukraine's troops reclaimed the city following clashes with Russia's incursion forces.
An elderly woman was killed during the attack, but approximately 60 people were saved throughout the strike by taking shelter in a basement, the BBC reported.
Earlier in the day, regional chief Oleg Sinegubov announced that "The Russian enemy's light vehicles broke into the city of Kharkiv," in a Facebook post, and urged residents not to leave shelters.
The incursion into Kharkiv arrived following a night of missile-fire on the municipality, according to the BBC.
