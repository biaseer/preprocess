But Putin told European Council President Charles Michel on Friday that such talks are paused because Ukraine put up a wall.
Putin sincerely believes in the nonsense he hears on Russian television and he wants to win big, said a person briefed on talks with the Russian leader.
Putin, who in the past was seriously considering a peace deal with Ukraine after Russia suffered setbacks last month, told people involved in peace efforts that he sees no prospects for a settlement, the Financial Times FT reported.
Moscow and Kyiv agreed on their first draft communique at a meeting in Istanbul in late March. However, talks stalled after Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimes in cities such as Bucha and Mariupol.

Putin also voiced his anger over the sinking of Moskva  the flagship of Russias Black Sea fleet  and said peace efforts are at a dead-end, another source told FT.
Russias President Vladimir Putin has lost interest in a diplomatic approach to ending his war with Ukraine and instead is set on seizing as much territory as possible, according to sources close to the matter.
There was hope for a deal. Putin was going back and forth. He needs to find a way to come out of this a winner, the source continued.
According to FT, Russian and Ukrainian negotiatorsfocused on a deal that would guarantee Kyivs security if it declares neutrality and abandons its hopes to join the NATO alliance.
