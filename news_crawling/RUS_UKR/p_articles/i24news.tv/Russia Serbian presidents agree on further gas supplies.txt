Russian President Vladimir Putin and Serbian leader Aleksandar Vucic approved in a phone call a continuation of Moscows supply of natural gas to Serbia, the Kremlin announced.
The two leaders also discussed the issue of Ukraine and Kosovo, according to the Kremlin. Since the beginning of Russias invasion in Ukraine Belgrade remained one of the few supporters of Russia facing criticism from other European countries.
Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he agreed on a new three-year gas supply contract with Putin. Vucic told reporters he couldnt disclose the price details, noting that it would be linked to the oil price. The announcement comes shortly before Serbias 10-year gas contract with Russias gas giant Gazprom expires on May 31.
Earlier in April, Russia stopped gas exports to Bulgaria and Poland in response to the countries refusal to pay for the supplies in rubles. The EU leaders accused Moscow of using gas as an instrument of blackmail.The EU and the US also announced a joint task force to ease Europes dependency on Russian gas and oil as it has been one of the major issues splitting the unity of European countries opposing Moscows aggression towards Ukraine.
