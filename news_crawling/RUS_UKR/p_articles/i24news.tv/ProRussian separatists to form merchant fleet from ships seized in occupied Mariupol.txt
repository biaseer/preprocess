"Today 2,500 tons of hot-rolled sheets left the port of Mariupol. The ship headed for the Russian city of Rostov," the head of the pro-Russian separatist territory wrote.
According to Russias head of the National Defense Control Center, Mikhail Mizintsev reported that six foreign vessels remained in the port of Mariupol: Tsarevna Bulgarian, Azburg Dominican Republic, Smarta Liberian, Blue Star Panaman, Azov Concorde Turkish, Lady Augusta Jamaican. The official claimed that the ship-owning countries did not take measures to withdraw these ships from the port.
Also on Tuesday, Denis Pushilin announced in a Telegram post that a ship left Mariupol for the first time since Russia occupied the city. It headed to Russia carrying metal sheets.
The Ukrainian side responded by saying that shipment of metal from Mariupol amounted to looting. Earlier this month Russia declared full control of Mariupol after Ukrainian fighters surrendered at the besieged Azovstal steel plant. Since then Russian authorities reported that the port was demined and reopened to commercial vessels.
The head of the DPR Denis Pushilin told journalists legal decisions will be made to justify the move.
The self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic announced they will nationalize foreign ships docked in the occupied Ukrainian port of Mariupol to create its own merchant fleet.
Part of the local courts will pass into the jurisdiction of the DPR. Appropriate decisions have already been made on this. These ships will be renamed. The flags that will be on them are also already clear, said Pushilin.
