Putin "stressed that the systematic shelling by the Ukrainian military of the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant creates the danger of a large-scale catastrophe," the Kremlin said in a statement, adding that both leaders called for an International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA inspection of the plant "as soon as possible."
Earlier this week, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi urged Russia and Ukraine, who blame each other for attacks at the plant, to immediately allow nuclear experts to assess the damage and evaluate safety and security at the sprawling nuclear complex where the situation has been deteriorating very rapidly.
Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia charged that Kyivs criminal attacks on nuclear infrastructure are pushing the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.
The Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia facility in southeastern Ukraine is Europes largest nuclear plant. While the plant is controlled by Russia, its Ukrainian staff continues to run the nuclear operations.
Since its invasion of its neighbor in February, Russia has strongly criticized the deliveries of Western weapons to Ukraine, accusing NATO of fueling the conflict.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin in a call with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron accused Ukraine of attacking theZaporizhzhia nuclear plant, warning of a potential "catastrophe," the Kremlin said Friday.
