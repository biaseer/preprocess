They are not here in this court of law: they are on a battlefield waging an aggressive war against my country, the official said, and called on Russia to lay down your arms and put forward your evidence.
Proceedings began Monday at the senior United Nations court on Russias allegations of a genocide in Ukraines separatists regions, with Moscows officials noticeably absent.
The hearings will focus on the interpretation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide - a 1948 treaty to which both Russia and Ukraine are signatories.
In February, Kyiv filed a case with the International Court of Justice ICJ to address Moscows claims of genocide being committed in the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, which a number of experts call groundless.
Kyiv argues that Moscow leveraged this narrative in order to invade and occupy these rebel areas and justify its incursion further into Ukraine.

Ukraine urged the top UN court to demand Russia immediately suspend the military operations that have as their stated purpose and objective the prevention and punishment of a claimed genocide in the eastern territories which compose the Donbas, according to ABC News.
