"May the authorities be filled with responsibility for their people, humility, and the readiness to serve them even if it costs them their life," added the patriarch at a sermon in Moscow.
"In fact, what kind of victory would be one that plants a flag on a heap of rubble?"
On the same day, Patriarch Kirill was quoted by Interfax as saying: "Let the Lord help us unite during this difficult time for our Fatherland, including around the authorities.
Pope Francis on Sunday called for an Easter truce in Ukraine, and in an apparent reference to Russia, questioned the value of planting a victory flag on a heap of rubble.

The Catholic leader spoke at the end of a Palm Sunday service for about 50,000 people in the Vatican Citys St. Peters Square.
