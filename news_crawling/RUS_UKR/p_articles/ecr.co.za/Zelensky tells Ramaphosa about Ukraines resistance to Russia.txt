Had a phone conversation with CyrilRamaphosa. Told about our resistance to Russian aggression. Discussed the threat of a global food crisis, deepening relations with the Republic of South Africa and cooperation within international organizations.
He says they've had a discussion on the phone and detailed his nation's resistance to Russian aggression.
With concerns growing for the civilians in war-hit Ukraine, leader Volodymyr Zelensky says he's been speaking to President Cyril Ramaphosa about strengthening relations with our country.
Our country believed the resolution was premature, saying it will lead to further divisions within the UN Assembly.
Earlier this month, South Africa abstained from voting on the suspension of Russia from the UN Human Rights Council over its invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, UN chief Antonio Guterres has now requested a meeting with the presidents of Russia and Ukraine in their respective capitals.
