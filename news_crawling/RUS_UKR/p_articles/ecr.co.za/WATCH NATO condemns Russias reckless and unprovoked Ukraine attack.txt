Stoltenberg has previously said NATO has no plans to send troops to fight in Ukraine if Russia attacked and key power Washington has ruled out deploying its forces to defend the country.
The statement came after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine and air and missile strikes happened in multiple locations across the country.

Putin has demanded guarantees from NATO and the US that Ukraine would never be granted membership.
Ukraine is not a member of the 30-nation Western military alliance but its attempt to join has angered the Kremlin leader.
