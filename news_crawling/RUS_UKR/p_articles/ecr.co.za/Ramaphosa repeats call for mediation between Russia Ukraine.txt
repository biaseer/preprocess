Responding to criticism that South Africa's abstention has placed itself on the wrong side of history, Ramaphosa says the country's firmly on the side of peace at a time when another war is something the world does not need, nor can it afford.
In his weekly newsletter to the nation, Ramaphosa went into detail to explain South Africa's reason for abstaining from a UN vote condemning Russia's military invasion of Ukraine.
He says in a world where far too many disputes between countries are settled through the barrel of a gun - South Africa expected the UN to call for peaceful negotiation.
The president says the call for political dialogue in the resolution was instead relegated to a single sentence at the bottom of the motion.
He has also pleaded with leaders to do everything in their power to come to an agreement that will bring an end to the hostilities.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on both Russia and Ukraine to subject the ongoing conflict between them to mediation.
