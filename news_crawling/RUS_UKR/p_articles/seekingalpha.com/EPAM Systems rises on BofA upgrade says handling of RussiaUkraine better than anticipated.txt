EPAM Systems NYSE:EPAM shares rose on Friday after Bank of America upgraded the software engineering company, noting the company's first-quarter results show the company is handling the Russian invasion of Ukraine "better than anticipated."
"We believe some customers may shy away to some extent from putting work in BelarusUkraine, but EPAM is diversifying its geographic headcount mix at a greater pace than anticipated, which in many cases is being driven by the relocation of existing EPAM employees," the analyst explained.
