Clark said likely to benefit from the move are Uranium Energy Corp NYSE American: UEC and enCore Energy TSXV: E.U. USOTCQB: ENCUF. He holds large positions in both companies, which are in pre-production.
United States and Canadian-based uranium companies are set to soar on a coming Russian production ban in the Western world, GoldSilver.coms senior precious metals analyst, Jeff Clark, told an industry audience at the VRIC conference in Vancouver on Tuesday.
He believes Russian uranium, which still accounts for about 50 of U.S. consumption, will soon be banned in retaliation for Russias invasion of Ukraine. Theyve done it for oil and gas, but they havent done it for uranium. But that is coming. That is a done deal. Its going to happen, he said.
According to Clark, in the US, theres widespread political support for a ban from every party except for a minority. It will lift and make the U.S. and Canadian uranium companies very, very attractive, the analyst pointed out.
Not only are they going to be more favoured because of bandwidth, whenever it comes, but theyre also going to be in production next year, said Clark.
Uranium is already in a bull market, Clark said. Yes, those prices have come down just like the others have, but for fundamental key reasons such as supply-demand  growing globally for uranium and nuclear power, he said.
Clark also highlighted Boss Energy ASX: BOE in Australia and Fission Uranium Corp. TSX: FCU in British Columbia, both projected to go into production in the next year.
Theyre still reliant on Russian uranium, yet the ban is coming. It will make U.S. and Canadian companies all that more attractive, he said.
