Planet has been posting satellite images showing Russian military movement before the February 24th invasion of Ukraine. It will have ongoing coverage of the invasion itself, all of which you can view here as more are uploaded.
The image above shows the Russian Navy in sailing in Mediterranean Sea towards Tartus, Syria at 7:57:57 UTC on February 24th, captured by a PlanetScope satellite. Planet Labs also provided a link to more information on the naval movements from NavalNews with the image.
Skysat also captured before and after shots from February 21st, 2022, and February 24th, 2022 of the Chuhuiv Air Base in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, and the Mykolaiv Air Base in Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine. Black smoke can be seen rising from the Chuhuiv Air Base after attacks, while smoke clouds have moved over the Mykolaiv Air Base due to nearby attacks.

Adam was always working with computers, which helped build his natural affinity for working with them, leading to him building his own at 14, after taking apart and tinkering with other old computers and tech lying around. Adam has always been very interested in STEM subjects, and is always trying to learn more about the world and the way it works.
