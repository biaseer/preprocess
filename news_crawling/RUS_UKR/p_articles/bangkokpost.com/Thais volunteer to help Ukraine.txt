Being more than 7,000 kilometres from Ukraine has not stopped a group of Thais from volunteering to help the country defend itself.
In a post on its Facebook account on Feb 27, the embassy of Ukraine appealed to foreigners to help the country fight against Russia:           "The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is addressing all citizens of the world, friends of Ukraine, peace and democracy. Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against Russia.           "Foreigners have the right to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine for military service under a contract of a voluntary basis to be included in the Territorial Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine," the embassy wrote.           About 20 Thais on Thursday turned up at the Ukrainian embassy to seek information about the recruitment process, and they formed a Line group named "volunteer soldiers to Ukraine" to share information.           One problem, however, is that many of those interested lack basic weapons training, while some are former conscripts but have no experience in actual battle, sources said.           According to a notice posted outside the embassy, applicants are required to submit documents, including proof of military training, via email to the embassy.           The notice also said volunteers must pay for their own travel expenses and other costs.
