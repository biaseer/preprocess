"Novaya Gazeta and I have decided to donate the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Medal to the Ukrainian Refugee Fund," Dmitry Muratov said in an article, Reuters reported.
"There are already over 10 million refugees," Muratov added. "I ask the auction houses to respond and put up for auction this world-famous award."
Muratov is currently editor-in-chief of the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, which has been critical of the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine, Reuters noted.
MOSCOW, Russia: A Russian journalist has announced that he is donating his Nobel Peace Prize to raise funds for Ukrainian refugees.
Some 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country, while another 6.5 million have been displaced within the country.
Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Russians have been detained for attending anti-war protests.
Muratov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Maria Ressa, a journalist from the Philippines, in 2021.
"Stop combat fire, exchange prisoners, release the bodies of the dead, provide humanitarian corridors and assistance, and support refugees," the paper said.
