The idea of a no-fly zone merits strong consideration. We may soon see Ukrainians slaughtered by Russian invaders who enjoy considerable military superiority. It has also become clear that the war over Ukraines future is part of a larger moral and strategic struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. No one focused clearly on what is at stake thinks that Putin can be allowed to win.
From the earliest hours of Vladimir Putins invasion to topple his government, President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to the United States and NATO to close the sky over Ukraine by enforcing a no-fly zone against Russian combat aircraft. The idea has been seized upon by Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinoiswho is an Air Force pilotand now over the weekend by retired four-star Air Force General Philip Breedlove. Others have been chiming in, including former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and chess master and Putin critic Garry Kasparov.
There are serious risks involved in a no-fly zone. It is a step to open war with Putin, a man already making nuclear threats. Lets carefully assess.
