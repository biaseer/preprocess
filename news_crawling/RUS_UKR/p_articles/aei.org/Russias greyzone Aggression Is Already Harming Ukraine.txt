Russia has moved around 100,000 soldiers to its border with Ukraine, worrying both Ukrainians and Nato members a great deal. The risk of an invasion is clearly the primary concern, but Russia doesnt have to send troops in to harm its south-western neighbour. The presence of soldiers is already spooking foreign investors  and has become in itself an excellent tool of aggression that Kyiv can do nothing to prevent.
In March 2014, when Russia had just annexed Crimea, the international community was anxious that Moscow would move on to target other nearby countries. Investors, too, were concerned, and stock markets slumped. Now, financial markets are similarly on edge. Since Russias military build-up was detected last month, the Ukrainian hryvnia has lost value, Ukraines sovereign dollar bonds have nosedived, and the cost of protection against a Ukrainian default has increased.
Financially speaking, Ukraine is already something of an acquired taste: given its history of corruption and oligarchic power, it appeals mostly to speciality investors with an elevated risk appetite. Last year, foreign direct investment in Ukraine was negative, while neighbouring Poland received a net FDI inflow of more than 10bn.
