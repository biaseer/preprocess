The June 2021 security patch is included in this latest release. It addresses 47 issues found within Googles Android operating system and 19 issues affecting Samsungs own software. A few critical issues have also been addressed.
SamMobile readers can circumvent this by downloading the latest Samsungfirmware update from our database and installing it manually on the Galaxy M51.
The new firmware update for the Galaxy M51 in India can be identified by firmware versionM515FXXU3CUG1. As always, the update should be accompanied by a notification on your phone, but Galaxy M51 users can try to trigger the update process from the Software update menu inside the Settings app.
Samsung began updating the Galaxy M51 with a new security patch last week, but the initial release happened in Russia and Ukraine. Now, the firmware update is reaching the Galaxy M51 in India, and the changelog represents more than the usual boring affair. It mentions enhanced Quick Share, Google RCS Rich Communication Services integration, and the addition of 360 Audio.
The new Galaxy M51 firmware update sounds similar to an earlier update that was released for the Galaxy A70 back in May. Same as before, the addition of 360 Audio will allow Galaxy M51 owners who use the Galaxy Buds Pro to replicate multi-dimensional surround sound through Dolby Head Tracking technology.
