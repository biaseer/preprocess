The Prime Minister addressed Commons after vowing Vladimir Putins hideous and barbaric venture in Ukraine must fail.
Speaking in the House of Commons he said:"At this stage, Ukrainians are offering a fierce defence of their families and their country.
"Now we see him for what he is, a blood-stained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest."
Although the UK and our allies tried every avenue for diplomacy until the final hour, I am driven to conclude that Putin was always determined to attack his neighbour, no matter what we did.
The Prime Minister added: Now we see him for what he is  a bloodstained aggressor, who believes in imperial conquest.
"These powers will enable us to totally exclude Russian banks from the UK financial system... stopping them from accessing Sterling and clearing payments through the UK.
