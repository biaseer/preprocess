The authors of the post on the Telegram channel say that the Russian soldier behind the wheel died instantly from the devastating explosion.
Some commentators speculate that he may not have walked into a mine, but rather an anti-tank projectile that he presented at the beginning of the footage, before shouting "Glory to Russia!" and start.
Russian soldier screams Honor to Russia and then drives his military truck over a Ukrainian anti-tank mine, killing him instantly.
It is not clear where the explosion occurred. In the video, you can hear Russian soldiers on the side urging the driver to press the accelerator harder to cross a bumpy road.
A Russian soldier thought he'd removed all the mines before making a little propaganda video for the folks back home. He was wrong. The video was first posted to Telegram and then to Twitter. As Visegrad24 wrote,
Footage filmed on the frontline in Ukraine shows the brutal death of a Russian soldier who had just praised his country for propaganda purposes.
