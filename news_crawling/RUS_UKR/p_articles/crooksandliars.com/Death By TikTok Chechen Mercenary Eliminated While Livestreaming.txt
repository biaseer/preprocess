Chechen mercenaries are known for posting inane online videos where they pose with their weapons and shoot at imaginary targets. Stupid exercises in false bravado. It's also a  favourite activity of the leader of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov.

This is a phrase in honour of the former president of Chechnya, Akhmat Kadyrov he was assassinated in 2004 - ed., The father of the current leader - Ramzan.
