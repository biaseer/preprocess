Military counterintelligence officers of the Security Service of Ukraine destroyed a Russian T-72 tank and 15 invaders with an attack drone.
"Mom, today we had such a circus today! At two o'clock in the morning, 15 "two hundred" people were watching a movie on the tank. In short, they threw a drone into the turret, damn it! A drone, mom, a drone, they just flew up, dropped the ammunition and it exploded. Everything was torn apart, everyone was torn apart, you understand, right?"
The special service gives the intercepted story of the occupier-eyewitness to his mother. According to the invader, his "colleagues" gathered on the tank to watch a movie.
As a result of a jewelry ? hit by a projectile from a Ukrainian combat copter, the occupiers were destroyed.
The Ukrainian Security Service released this intercepted call from a young Russian soldier detailing the gruesome scene he witnessed after 15 Russian tank operators were "demilitarized" by a Ukrainian drone. Seems the Russian soldiers had gathered on top of tank to watch a movie together at night. That proved to be unwise as they were soon spotted, the Ukrainian SBU sending out a drone that eliminated them in short order.
