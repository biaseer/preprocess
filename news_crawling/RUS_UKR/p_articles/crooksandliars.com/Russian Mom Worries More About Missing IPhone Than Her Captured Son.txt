"Well, it's not surprising, actually. They still owe payments for the phone, and they got their now captured child for free."
The financial situation in Russia has significantly worsened since the start of Vladimir Putins war against Ukraine due to the sanctions imposed by the West. Despite reports that show the Russian president trying to conceal the hardship faced by his people, the country is said to have been impoverished.
The Ukrainian interviewer asks, "Your son is in captivity. He might have been killed. And you are concerned about some phone? How is that appropriate?" And after she explains the family's plight, the interviewer asks her, "And didnt you think, there could be a completely other question: Where is my son?'"
In this latest event, a woman appears so indifferent to her sons fate, and on the other hand, anxious about the debt her family is into, that she worries about her sons iPhone and not his life.
Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, shared the video with the caption: "Russian mum worries about her captured son's iPhone 13 much more than about her son.
Apparently, his grandparents bought him a brand new iPhone 13 but are now stuck making payments on his missing phone, a financial burden for the family.
