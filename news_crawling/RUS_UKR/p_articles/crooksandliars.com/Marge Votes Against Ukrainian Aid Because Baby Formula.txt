The aid package passed the House easily on a huge bipartisan margin at 368-57, that left her as an outcast in her own party.
Giving aid and comfort to Russia, Marge barked that giving Ukraine 40 billion dollars was insane.  The US can do many things at one time, including sending monies to Ukraine for weapons, food, etc...
QAnon "Klan Mom" Marjorie Taylor Greene told the former convicted felon Dinesh D'Souza on his podcast yeah that she voted against aid for Ukraine because of baby formula.
Greene whined about the southern border and then used COVID supply chain issues to defend her "no" vote.
Greene has been a severe critic of any U.S. help going to Ukraine since the illegal invasion by Russia began.
