Finland stayed in Soviet crosshairs not only because of its history involving the Russian Empire but also because its border fell dangerously close to Leningrad St. Petersburg near the Baltic Sea.
Finland saw its way out of the Russian Empire during the Russian Revolution of 1917 when communists overthrew the country's monarchy.
