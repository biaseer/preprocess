"Russias assault into northern Ukraine ended in a costly failure. Russia failed to implement its own principles of war," the Ministry said in a tweet. "With the limited combat readiness of many units, it spread its forces too thinly without enough support from artillery and combat aircraft."
The release comes as the Russia-Ukraine war has reached the 100-day mark. It began on Feb. 24.

The video shows during the first 30 days of the war, Russia steadily progressed towards Kyiv in hopes of capturing Ukraines capital city.
Then in the next 20 days, Russias forces were completely pushed out of northern Ukraine.
The U.K. Ministry of Defense said Russias initial strategy was "based on wildly optimistic assessments about the welcome Russian troops would receive in Ukraine."
"Russia has now adopted a strategy of attrition and is achieving slow and costly gains in the Donbas," it added.
The United Kingdoms Ministry of Defense released a time-lapse video Friday showing Russias territorial gains and losses during its invasion of Ukraine, calling Moscows effort to seize the northern part of the country a "costly failure."
