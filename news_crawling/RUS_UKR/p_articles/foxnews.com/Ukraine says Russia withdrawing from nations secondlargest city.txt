The fight continues  after failing to capture Ukraine's capital  and the Ukrainian military chief for the Luhansk province said Friday that Russian troops had nearly full control of Rubizhne.
According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR there have been 7,389 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 3,573 deaths and 3,816 injuries.
However, the death toll is "thousands higher" than reported, according to a United Nations U.N. official.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid Ukraine's forces had also made some headway, retaking six towns or villages.
In his nightly video address late Friday, the leader said that "no one today can predict how long the war will last.
President Biden said earlier this month that he is concerned that Russian President Vladimir Putin"doesn't have a way out" and will continue his brutal war in an attempt to save face at home.
"This will depend, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already giving their maximum," Zelenskyy noted. "This will depend on our partners, on European countries, on the entire free world."
Ukraines general staff said the troops were pulling back from the country's second-largest city and focusing on guarding supply routes.
