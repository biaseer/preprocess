As a result, a number of refugees will be in need of a new home.
More than 1,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the county under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, launched in March after the Russian invasion.
A number of households that participated in the scheme are now four months into their six-month contract.
Suffolk County Council is urging more people to take in Ukrainian refugees already in the county.
Cllr Bobby Bennett, Cabinet Member for Equality and Communities, said: We are in need of a wide range of homes for single people, mums with children and complete families. Anything self-contained is especially helpful  for example, if you have a second home or an annexe.
If you think you can help, or know anyone who is interested, please visit homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk.
Some may not be able to continue hosting beyond this time due to changes in personal reasons, such as health, unexpected family events or bereavement.
Sponsors will receive 350 a month tax-free which will be paid for by the government for up to 12 months.
