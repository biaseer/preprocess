American social news aggregation platform, Reddit, quarantined subeditor rRussia and rRussiaPoliticsdue to misinformation amidst the international condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues.
Subedits like rRussia have supported and justified the attacks on Ukraine while spreading propaganda and misinformation against Ukraine, calling their president a war criminal and the people, Nazis. Much of the content posted is biased, uncharacterized, and quickly debunked.
Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
Subedits that have been quarantined on Reddit don't appear insearches, recommendations, or feeds unless specified. Users interested in joining the quarantined community are issued a warning regarding the content being posted before they are allowed access to the group. In trying to join the rRussia subedit, the site warns of "a high volume of information not supported by credible sources."
The rRussia subedit now displays a blank header and background after it has been quarantined, previously displaying the Russian flag andSaint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. rRussia users are calling Reddit quarantine censorship and restricting freedom of speech. The community had around265,000 Reddit subscribers.
