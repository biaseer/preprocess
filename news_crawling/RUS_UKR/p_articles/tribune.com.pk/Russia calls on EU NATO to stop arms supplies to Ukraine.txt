It was not immediately clear how Washington could assist in the transfer of Russian-made aircraft. However, it could facilitate transactions or possibly become involved in payment or providing replacements for allies who give Ukraine jets.
It said Moscow was particularly worried that portable anti-aerial Stinger missiles could end up in the hands of terrorists, posing a threat to airlines.
Russia's foreign ministry called on European Union and NATO countries on Saturday to "stop pumping weapons" to Ukraine, the Russian RIA news agency said.
Zelenskiy has repeatedly asked the West to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but the US and its NATO allies have rebuffed those calls fearing a direct confrontation with Moscow.
In the Democratic-controlled US Congress, there is strong bipartisan support for $10 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine following Russia's Feb 24 invasion.
The US instead has promised Zelenskiy military aid, and the Ukrainian leader "made a desperate plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine" during Saturday's video call, Schumer said.
Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a "desperate plea" for aircraft to fight Russian invaders during a video call Saturday with US legislators, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
"These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer," Schumer said in a statement. More than 280 members of the Senate and House of Representatives took part in the call.
