Olga Lautman, an analyst and researcher focusing on Russia and Ukraine, posted screenshots of the blunder on social media.
American news outlet Bloomberg has issued an apology after accidentally reporting that Russia had invaded Ukraine.
Russia has repeatedly denied the claims, accusing Washington and its allies of deliberately escalating the situation.
Unfortunately, the American media in recent months has been publishing a very large amount of unverified, distorted, and deliberately false and provocative information about what is happening in Ukraine and around it, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this past Monday.
We prepare headlines for many scenarios and the headline Russia Invades Ukraine was inadvertently published around 4 p.m. ET today on our website, read a Bloomberg statement.
As tensions soar on the Russia-Ukraine border, Western countries led by the US have been warning of an imminent attack by Moscow.
This is already becoming obvious to almost everyone, he added, commenting on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys recent statement that the threat of war had not grown but the fuss has increased.
Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
The Bloomberg blunder comes just days after Moscow lashed out at US media for spreading false and provocative information about the Ukraine situation.
We deeply regret the error. The headline has been removed and we are investigating the cause.
A headline  Live: Russia Invades Ukraine  went up on the home page of the financial news site at around 2100GMT.
