However, Moscows lead negotiator cautioned that Russias promise to scale down military operations did not represent a ceasefire and a formal agreement with Kyiv had a long way to go.
Oil prices dropped on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous day on signs of progress in talks between Russia and Ukraine to end their weeks-long conflict, with prices further pressured by Chinas new lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Russia promised at the peace talks to scale down its military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine, while Ukraine proposed adoption of neutral status but with international guarantees that it would be protected from attack.
