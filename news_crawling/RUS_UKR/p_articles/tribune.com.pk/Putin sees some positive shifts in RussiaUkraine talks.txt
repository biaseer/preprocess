Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that there were some "positive shifts" in talks between Russian and Ukraine, two weeks into Moscow's military campaign in the country.
Russia has been hit by a barrage of international sanctions since Putin sent troops to Ukraine.
"There are certain positive shifts, negotiators from our side reported to me," Putin told his Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko during a televised meeting in Moscow.
"The USSR really lived in the conditions of sanctions and still developed and achieved colossal successes," Putin said.
But the Russian leader, who is also a former KGB agent, brushed these off Friday.
Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
The talks have led to the opening of several humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from combat areas. Both sides have accused each other of blocking these efforts.
Russian and Ukrainian negotiators have held several rounds of talks since Putin sent in troops to the country on February 24.
