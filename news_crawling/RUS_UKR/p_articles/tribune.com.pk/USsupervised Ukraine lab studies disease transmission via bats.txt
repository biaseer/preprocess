"Specialists of the Russian Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces have studied original documents revealing the details of the US implementation of a secret project to study the ways of transmitting diseases to humans through bats in a laboratory in Ukraine's Kharkov," the ministry's spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.
Last week, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland testified before a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Ukraine, admitting "Ukraine has biological research facilities."
"According to the documents, these studies were carried out on a systematic basis and under direct supervision of US specialists for many years," he told a briefing.
On March 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video post on his facebook account that "no chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land."
Russia has expressed grave concerns over US-funded biological laboratories in Ukraine, where various kinds of dangerous viruses were stored and studied.
The Russian Defense Ministry on Thursday disclosed a package of documents showing that biological laboratories in Ukraine received a total of 32 million U.S. dollars of funding from the Pentagon. GLOBALink pic.twitter.comR53vdBBSey
