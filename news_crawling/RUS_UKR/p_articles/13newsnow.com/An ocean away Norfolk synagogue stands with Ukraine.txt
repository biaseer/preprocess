"We are standing with the people of Ukraine and we will do anything we can to help as Jews, as Americas, as human beings," she added.
"The missile that hit close to Babyn Yar which was the scene of the massacre of 33,000 Jews definitely evoked terrible memories."
Music filled the chapel at Ohef Sholom Temple on Friday with an opening song written in Odesa, Ukraine, a city that is now bracing for Russian troops.
"As Jewish people, we feel deeply the suffering of all humans," she said. "It isnt specifically a Jewish war but nonetheless it is upon us who have known the horrors of the holocaust to speak out."
"It would be over the line to call Ukraine sacred to Jews, but it wouldnt be way over the line," she said during her sermon.
NORFOLK, Va.  As Ukrainians fight for their country and fear for their loved ones, the Jewish community in Norfolk feels a sense of responsibility to speak out.
"I think were seeing a tragedy of epic proportions and a miscarriage of justice and senseless violence and killing and destruction," says Rabbi Roz Mandelberg.
"One of which is to speak out, one of which is to contribute financially wherever they can. Another of which of course is to pray, always to pray. And the fourth, which is a little bit harder, is to remain unified even if we have to make sacrifices because the economic sanctions that we are trying to use to pressure to stop this senseless war."
She said even though we are almost 5,000 miles away, there are ways to help.
Ukraine has the fifth largest Jewish population in Europe, so Rabbi Roz says they have a responsibility to speak out against Vladimir Putins actions.
