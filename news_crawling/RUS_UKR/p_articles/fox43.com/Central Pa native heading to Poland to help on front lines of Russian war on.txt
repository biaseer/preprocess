Theyre not perfect, but theyre warm, theyre hospitable, theyre freedom-loving and in a matter of speaking, they wake up one day and their country is being invaded, said Parsons.
Evangelical churches, different stripes, Pentecostal, Baptist, bible churches, and so forth, theyre all coming together for these Ukrainian people who are in such desperate need, he said.
It was that close to where our kids grew up, where they spent many of their younger years, that close to our church, so very quickly did the war become a reality in our mind and our hearts, said Parsons.
Mission Eurasia has already worked to distribute 6,000 care packagesfilled with food, medicine, diapers, bibles and moreall over Ukraine.
We in the West, we all over the world, have to do everything we can to come alongside the Ukrainians, explained Parsons.
As a member of Mission Eurasia, an organization which works to train and equip church leaders across Europe and Asia, Don is now heading to Poland to help on the front lines.
Theyre being shipped into the center of the country, into the east of the country, the south of the country, to the places that have been most heavily hit and are most heavily under threat at the moment, said Parsons.
While there, he and his wife helped establish a church in the city of Kyiv.
Just a few days into Russias war on Ukraine, a residential building sitting a few hundred yards away from that same church was hit and severely damaged.
He says its the least they can do to help the Ukrainians, who he worked closely with during his time there.
