In the eighth week of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces have left the outskirts of Kyiv and are focusing their attacks in the east.
After weeks of relative peace, the western city of Lviv was hit by at least four missiles Monday. At least seven people were killed in the attack, and another 11 were injured, marking the first fatalities the city had seen since Russia's invasion began in late February.
Their troops have reportedly taken control of the town of Kreminna in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region after weeks of bombardment. In Mariupol, Ukrainian forces are refusing to surrender, despite Russia's long and bloody siege.
Russia continued its assault on Ukraine from multiple directions, including bombings areas of Ukraine's capital city Kyiv.
