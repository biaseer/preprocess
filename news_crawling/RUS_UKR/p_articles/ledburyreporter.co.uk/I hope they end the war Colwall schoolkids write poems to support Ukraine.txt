Year Two pupils from Colwall CofE Primary School all wrote poems based on the theme "What is Ukraine".
In a post on Facebook, a school spokesperson said: "Weve all been shocked and saddened by the current events in Ukraine.
"If these 6-year-olds are the future then I think our future is in very safe hands.
One of the poems reads: "I hope they end the war. I hope Ukraine and Russia end the war and agree to talk."

The class agreed Ukraine "is not war or something to be destroyed" and looked through a picture book about Ukraine to decide what it really is.
"Year two have chosen to look at the beauty of Ukraine and have written these poems entitled What is Ukraine?
"We agreed as a class that Ukraine isnt war nor is it something to be destroyed.
