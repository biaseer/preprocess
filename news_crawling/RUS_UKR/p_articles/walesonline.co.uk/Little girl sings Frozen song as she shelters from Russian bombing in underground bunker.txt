Marta said she filmed the girl, whose age is not known, while visiting a bomb shelter in Kyiv.
People have been living in makeshift bunkers since the start of the invasion more than 10 days ago. Even these newborn twins had to have treatment while underground.
"Bravo! Bravo!" the crowd shouted, as the girl wearing a star jumper clutches her hands in front of her face.
"Seeing in one of the Kyiv bomb storage, how children draw bright pictures in half-darkness, I, of course, couldn't silently pass by... stopped, praised, offered to do a little exhibition to somehow decorate this not so happy place," she said.
Marta Smekhova, who posted the video, said: "'From the first word in the bomb shelter came complete silence... everyone put their business aside and listen to a song by this girl who was just beaming light... even men couldn't hold back the tears.
A video of a little girl singing Frozen's 'Let It Go' as she shelters from the bombing in Ukraine has gone viral.
After the video was posted on Facebook, with the permission of her mother, it has been viewed thousands of times around the world.
Shelling also continued in the suburbs of Kyiv which has been cut off from electricity, water and heating for three days.
The Okhmadet childrens' hospital in central Kyiv has been moved underground with sick children and women with their newborn babies being treated in a basement, and many families have been living underground for days.
On Monday, March 7, Russian military forces opened fire on the city of Mykolaiv, 480 kilometres south of Kyiv, according to Ukraine's General Staff.
When Amelia finishes, the crowd, who had listened in silence, erupts in cheers and applause.
The girl, who is named Amelia, sang the song beautifully to try and keep spirits high in an underground bunker in the city.
