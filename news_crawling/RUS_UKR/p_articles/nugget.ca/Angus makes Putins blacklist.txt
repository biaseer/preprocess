Anguss name appears as No. 9 on the list of Canadians being targeted by Putin.
Early on in the war, Angus pushed for a parliamentary motion to rename the street in front of the Russian embassy in Ottawa to honour Ukrainian PresidentZelenskyy.
Since the war broke out, the Canadian government has been putting increasing financial pressure on the Putin regime and their oligarch friends.
Putin is acting like an international criminal. I will not be intimidated by Putins blacklist. I will continue to speak up in defence of the Ukrainian people.
Angus isnt sure if this move got under Putins skin, but says he wears the blacklist with pride.
I will do what I can to keep Canada focused on pushing for an end to this brutal and illegal conflict.

Timmins-James Bay MP Charlie Angus is one of 300 Canadians targeted for blacklisting by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
I think of the ordinary Russian people who have no desire to be dragged into this ugly conflict.
