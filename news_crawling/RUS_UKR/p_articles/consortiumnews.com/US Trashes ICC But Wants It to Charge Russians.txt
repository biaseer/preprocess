But the ICCs jurisdictional scheme for the crime of aggression is much more restrictive than its regime for punishing the other crimes under the Rome Statute  genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
An armed attack can include bombing or attacking the armed forces of other country. The attack must be a manifest violation of the U.N.

The prohibition on aggression is so basic that it is considered to bejus cogens, a preemptory norm of international law which can never be committed under any circumstances. There is no immunity defense or statute of limitations for ajus cogensnorm.
but they are generally not quite so horrified, and more likely to accept official justifications, when they hear that civilians are killed by U.S. forces or American weapons in Iraq, Syria, Yemen or Gaza.
