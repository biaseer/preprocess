On Friday, Washington also accused Russia of staging an incident that could act as the pretext to invade its pro-Western neighbor.
Ukraine said yesterday it had "evidence" Russia was behind a cyberattack that knocked out government websites on Friday.
Microsoft warned that the cyberattack could affect more organizations than initially feared and that the malware could render government digital infrastructure inoperable.
Tensions are at an all-time high, with Ukraine accusing Russia of amassing troops on its border ahead of a possible invasion. Some analysts fear the cyberattack targeting 70 government websites could be the prelude to a military attack.
The Kremlin rejected the claims. "Ukrainians are blaming everything on Russia, even their bad weather," Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, said.
