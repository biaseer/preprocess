Russia yesterday said it was pulling back some of its forces near the Ukrainian border in what would be the first major step toward de-escalation in weeks of crisis with the West.
If Western officials confirm Moscow was indeed taking steps to reduce its forces near Ukraine it would ease fears of a major war in Europe that have been rising for weeks. Still, comments from Putin's foreign and defense ministers on Monday had already offered hope of a de-escalation.
Russia, which has repeatedly denied any plan to invade Ukraine, already controls the peninsula of Crimea that it seized from Ukraine in 2014 and supports separatist forces controlling parts of eastern Ukraine.
It was yesterday morning that a Russian defense ministry spokesman said some forces deployed near Ukraine were leaving.
And Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin some Russian military drills launched in December were "ending" and more would end "in the near future."
The move came amid an intense diplomatic effort to avert a feared Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor. Moscow amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders.
The Russian leader and his top aides have argued that the crisis is the result of the United States and western Europe ignoring Moscow's legitimate security concerns.
During a carefully choreographed meeting with Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said "there is always a chance" of reaching an agreement with the West over Ukraine.
The Kremlin insists NATO must give assurances Ukraine will never be admitted as a member and roll back its presence in eastern European countries.
The crisis reached a peak this week, with US officials warning a full-scale invasion was possible within days.
