U.S. President Joe Biden condemned Putin's invasion during his State of the Union address Tuesday night.
"We're not considering each other as enemies here," said Alex Kushkov, owner of Dynamo Fencing Center, who came to the U.S. from Ukraine 10 years ago.
Slezinger and Kushkiv said they understand the delicate balance in an unpredictable war, but added that the message from Biden is a message that should resonate around the world.
Caf St. Petersburg in Newton Centre is a gathering spot for people of many cultures who are now united against a bloody war.
"As we can see, Putin is kind of uncontrollable. He's an insane person: an irrational, insane person and nobody knows what he will do next," Kushkiv said.
"Ukrainians, Russians, Georgians, Armenians: We as a community, we condemn what's going on in Ukraine," said Galina Slezinger, owner of Caf St. Petersburg, who moved to the United States from Russia in 1979.
As attacks intensify on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Kushkiv constantly checks on his mother, who is huddling in a bomb shelter in Kyiv. He said he is worried about Russian President Vladimir Putin's next move.
"I hope it will be nice and clear for everybody that this is a threat not only for Ukraine, it's a threat for the whole world," Kushkiv said. "We're all one in the same: stop the war."
