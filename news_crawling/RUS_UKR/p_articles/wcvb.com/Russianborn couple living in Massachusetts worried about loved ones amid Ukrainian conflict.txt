The couple has been sending news about the Ukrainian conflict to family members and friends living in Russia and calling them to share perspectives, but they say it seems like their family has no comment on the matter.
"They feel it can be a potential problem with a job, with education," Semenov said.
Alex Semenov and Natalia Semenova left Russia 20 years ago and now live in Stoughton, which has a sizeable Russian population much like the nearby Massachusetts communities of Canton and Sharon.
"In Russia, they've got several channels but it's still the same propaganda," Semenova said. "They said, like, 'No, it's not a war. It's a military operation.' Because it's prohibited by law now in Russia to call this war a war."
According to the couple, their family and friends will not text them back and they are very quiet on WhatsApp calls.
"People are really afraid ... someone said, 'They can arrest me if I said everything that you said,'" Semenova said.
"We cannot live like this," Semenova said. "We need to speak up. Otherwise, if everybody will be silent, we can't stop this war."
A Russian-born couple living in Massachusetts is worried about their loved ones overseas regarding their response to what's happening in Ukraine.
Semenov and Semenova are anxious about their relatives in Russia, who are on edge and fear retaliation if they agree with the West or support Ukraine.
The couple said independent media is being stifled in Russia, as images on Russian government television tell one story.
