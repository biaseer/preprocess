Keating also addressed Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent and more threatening statements, including a warning that a no-fly zone over Ukraine would constitute a declaration of war.
The congressman said it has become clear over the years that the U.S. has to watch what Putin does instead of what he says.
U.S. Rep. William Keating, who represents the 9th congressional district of Massachusetts, said a no-fly zone is off the table.
During the hourlong Zoom meeting, Zelenskyy pleaded for more lethal and military aid from Ukraine's foreign allies and expressed frustrations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO for not declaring a no-fly zone over his country.
"The bombings of college dormitories the day before. The bombings of two kindergartens, including a special education school with 50 children killed," Keating said. "They're taking the municipal officials in one of the major cities and holding them hostage, taking the mayor of that city into a basement, torturing him and killing him."
A Massachusetts congressman is one of more than 300 United States lawmakers who were on a video call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday.
Keating said Zelenskyy also shared horrific details of the terrifying devastation that is happening in Ukraine at the hands of the Russian military.
"That would entail us knocking out ground defenses and air defenses by Russia, as well as downing Russian aircrafts. That would certainly lead us into a full-scale war where they will be more deaths," Keating said during a live interview with NewsCenter 5 Sunday morning.
