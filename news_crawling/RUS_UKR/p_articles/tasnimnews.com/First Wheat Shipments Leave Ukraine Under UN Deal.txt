Ukraine has some 20 million tonnes of grain left over from last years crop, while this years wheat harvest is also estimated at 20 million tonnes.
The Belize-flagged Sormovsky left Ukraines Chornomorsk port on Friday, Turkeys defense ministry said, carrying 3,050 tonnes of wheat to Turkeys northwestern Tekirdag province.
So far most of the cargoes under the deal have carried grain for animal feed or for fuel.
The Marshall Island-flagged Star Laura also departed from the port of Pivdennyi, bound for Iran with 60,000 tonnes of corn aboard, the ministry said.
It was the first shipment of wheat from Ukraine, which, along with Russia, accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports before Feb. 24, when Moscow launched what it describes as a special operation to demilitarize its neighbor, Reuters reported.
A total of 14 ships have now departed from Ukraine over the past two weeks, following the deal with Russia to allow a resumption of grain exports from Ukraines Black Sea ports, after they were stalled for five months due to the war.
The agreement, brokered by the United Nations along with Turkey, was reached last month amid fears that the loss of Ukrainian grain supplies would lead to severe food shortages and even outbreaks of famine in parts of the world.
