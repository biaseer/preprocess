"The choice of a venue for some hypothetical meeting is a secondary issue, although, of course, we are grateful to all countries that express their willingness to assist this negotiation process," he maintained, TASS reported.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with the RBC TV channel on March 16 that Swiss colleagues had approached him with a proposal on mediation at the talks between Moscow and Kiev. Turkey and Israel also made similar proposals.
"Actually, someone who can do this should exert their influence on Kiev to make Kiev more cooperative, more constructive in these talks," the presidential press secretary said.
Earlier, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said that Switzerland was ready to act as a mediator at the Ukrainian settlement talks or host the negotiations and added that "Switzerland had both neutrality and the humanitarian tradition".
