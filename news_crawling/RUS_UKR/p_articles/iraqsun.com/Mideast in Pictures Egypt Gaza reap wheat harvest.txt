Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, imports 80 percent of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.
CAIRO, May 9 Xinhua -- Egypt's Agriculture Ministry said on Sunday that a total of 220,000 feddans were cultivated with wheat this year, despite some challenges topped by water scarcity.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Palestinians depend entirely on the imports of wheat both in terms of food and animal feed, with 35,000 to 40,000 tons of imports annually to cover the demand of each.
Besides, new silos are now receiving 5.6 million tons of wheat in a way compatible with wheat storage standards to achieve self-sufficiency of the grain.
The Palestinian territories have been suffering from a shortage of supply and soaring local wheat and flour prices, both the main source of imports, since the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine conflict in late February.
