"Pakistan doesn't believe in camp politics and wants excellent relations with all countries, especially the United States, the European Union, China, Russia, and others," Bajwa said, CNN reported.
During a speech on Saturday, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff Qamar Javed Bajwa said Russia's invasion, which has left thousands dead, is "very unfortunate" and a "huge tragedy," according to the report.
However, Pakistan sent emergency aid to Ukraine after the request from the country's embassy in Islamabad, according to reports.
Bajwa's comments come as Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan previously did not publicly denounce Putin's actions following pressure from the West, The Hill reported.
A Pakistan official called for "immediate cessation" of the war between Russia and Ukraine, CNN reported.
Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a war on Ukraine in late February, causing millions to flee to neighboring countries. His move was met with a wave of international condemnation.
"What do you think of us? Are we your slaves ... that whatever you say, we will do?" Khan said in response to a letter calling for Pakistan to back a resolution to condemn Moscow's attack last month, the outlet reported.
