The missile attacks come two days after Russian troops reportedly seized the remnants of the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
In a brief televised address this morning  marking his first public remarks since Friday  Putin saluted the "heroism" of Russian special forces fighting in Ukraine, the Guardian reported.
Russian missiles hit a radioactive waste disposal site near Kyiv, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine SNRIU said in a statement early Sunday morning.
"The automated radiation monitoring system failed," SNRIU said in the statement. "But the surveillance cameras recorded the falling missiles."
The attack happened at about 1:20 am local time on Sunday at a disposal site of the Kyiv branch of the State Specialized Enterprise "Radon." It is unclear where exactly this site is located.
However, the agency said that preliminary assessments show there is currently no threat from the radioactive waste impacting areas outside the site.
Ukraine's nuclear agency said that its monitoring systems showed radiation levels rising at several points at and near the site. Russia has denied there had been a change in radiation levels.
The extent of the radiation cannot be assessed until fighting in the area has ceased, SNRIU added.
