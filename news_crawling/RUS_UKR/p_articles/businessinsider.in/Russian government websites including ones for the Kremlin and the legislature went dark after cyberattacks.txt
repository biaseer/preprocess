NetBlocks, which tracks disruptions and shutdowns, confirmed on Twitter that multiple sites went offline shortly after 8:45 p.m. local time in Moscow.
Among those impacted were the sites of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers, and Parliament.
Multiple Russian government websites reportedly went down on Thursday after the country launched an attack on Ukraine.
The Kremlin's website and that of the Russian Federal Assembly's lower house  or State Duma  were both down for at least 15 minutes. As of 9 p.m. local time, the State Duma website was since restored.
This comes after one day after a suspected cyberattack shut down a handful of Ukraine's government websites.
