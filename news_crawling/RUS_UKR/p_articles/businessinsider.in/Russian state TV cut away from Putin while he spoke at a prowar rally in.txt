Putin spoke at the Luzhniki Stadium to mark the eighth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea and used the occasion to justify Russia's attack on Ukraine.
A Kremlin spokesperson told Reuters that the feed cut out because of technical issues, and that Putin later appeared on the feed.
The Meduza editor Kevin Rothrock also shared a video on Twitter, which he said showed people leaving the stadium before the event started.
Reuters reported that Putin told the crowd that Russia would be successful in the ongoing invasion into Ukraine.
"Shoulder to shoulder, they help each other, support each other and when needed they shield each other from bullets with their bodies like brothers. Such unity we have not had for a long time," he said, Reuters reported.
Max Seddon, a Financial Times journalist, tweeted that "lots of reports" said state employees had been bused in for the event.
Putin once again used the term "special military operation," which he used in his February 24 televised war declaration against Ukraine, and said it was helping to unify Russia.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has now passed the three-week mark, appears to have stalled on all fronts as Putin's forces struggle to break Ukraine's resistance.
"We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans," Putin said, Reuters reported.
A video showed that while Putin was in the middle of addressing the crowd, the TV feed cut away from his speech to a musical performance  and the Russian leader was nowhere to be seen.
