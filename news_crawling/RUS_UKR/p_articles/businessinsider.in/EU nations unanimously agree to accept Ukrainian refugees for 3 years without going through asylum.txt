Leyen added: "We support our Eastern Member States in hosting and taking care of these refugees."
As Insider previously reported, countries in central Europe have been bracing for the wave of migrants before the war even began.
The EU collectively agreed to let in Ukrainian refugees for up to three years, without the requirement to first apply for asylum, The BBC reported on Sunday.
BBC's Katya Adler reported that German interior minister Nancy Faeser announced the measure following a meeting of European leaders over the weekend on how to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The exception comes after Russia launched a large-scale invasion against Ukraine on Thursday, leading thousands of people to flee their homes. On Sunday, the UN's refugee agency reported that nearly 370,000 people have traveled from Ukraine into neighboring countries  including Poland and Moldova  and beyond.
On Sunday, European Commissioner for Home Affairs said that the EU should anticipate large numbers, adding that "we should be prepared for millions," CNN reported.
During a news briefing Sunday, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen championed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his "bravery."
"We welcome with open arms those who have to flee from Putin's bombs," Leyen said.
