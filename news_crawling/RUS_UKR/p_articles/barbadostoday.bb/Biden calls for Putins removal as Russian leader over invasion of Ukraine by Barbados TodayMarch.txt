In what was billed by the White House as a major address, Biden spoke in front of the Royal Castle, one of Warsaws notable landmarks that was badly damaged during the Second World War.
He borrowed the words of Polish-born Pope John Paul II and cited anti-communist Polish dissident and former president, Lech Walesa, as he warned that Putins invasion of Ukraine threatens to bring decades of war.
In this battle we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days, or months, either, Biden said.
SOURCE: AP  President Joe Biden on Saturday called for Russian leader Vladimir Putins removal, saying, For Gods sake, this man cannot remain in power.
Biden also used a speech in Polands capital to make a vociferous defence of liberal democracy and the NATO military alliance, while also saying Europe must steel itself for a long fight against Russian aggression.
The crowd of about 1,000 included some of the Ukrainian refugees who have fled for Poland and elsewhere in the midst of the brutal invasion.
