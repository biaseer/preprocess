We agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River, it read.
Zelensky had earlier said he would not meet a Russian delegation on Belarusian territory because Russias invasion was launched in part from Belarus.
