This comes days after media reports claimed that some Bangladeshi expatriates in Ukraine had taken up arms to defend the country against Russian forces.
Dhaka, Bangladesh - On its official Facebook page, the Russian embassy in Dhaka claimed Thursday afternoon that Bangladeshis have offered to fight alongside the Russian army in Ukraine. Many even offered to fight for free.
"We appreciate the Bangladeshi people's noble desire. The special military operation, on the other hand, is going according to plan, with the Russian Armed Forces achieving set goals and objectives." However, it added, "there is no need for volunteers from Bangladesh to join the operation."
Since February 11, a large number of Bangladeshi citizens have expressed an interest in volunteering for the war in Ukraine and the Russian-backed Donbas region, according to the embassy.
