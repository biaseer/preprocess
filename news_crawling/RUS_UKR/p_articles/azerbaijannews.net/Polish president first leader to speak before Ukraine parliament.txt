KYIV, Ukraine: Andrzej Duda, President of Poland, told lawmakers in Kyiv this week that Ukraine has the right to decide its own future.Duda became the first foreign leader to speak in-person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia's 24th February invasion.Any peace agreement that would involve ceding territory has been ruled out by Ukraine, dismissing calls for a ceasefire that would involve Russian forces remaining in Ukraine."Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin's demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future- nothing about you, without you," Duda said.The international community must demand that Russia completely withdraw from Ukrainian territory, he said, adding, "If Ukraine is sacrificed for economic reasons or political ambitions, even a centimeter of its territory, it will be a huge blow, not only for the Ukrainian nation, but for the entire Western world."Since the start of the Russian invasion, Poland has positioned itself as one of Kyiv's staunchest allies, as Warsaw is also a strong advocate of tough sanctions against Russia, and has been vocal in its support of Ukraine becoming a member of the European Union EU."I will not rest until Ukraine becomes a member of the EU," Duda said.
