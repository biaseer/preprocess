After abandoning its bungled attempt to storm Ukraines capital of Kyiv two months ago, Russia declared that taking the entire Donbas is its main objective. Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian government forces in the Donbas since 2014, and the region has borne the brunt of the Russian onslaught in recent weeks.
In only his second trip abroad since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Putin conferred with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the conflict in Syria.
Syria is a strong ally of Russia, which joined Syrias conflict in September 2015 helping tip the balance of power in favor of President Bashar Assad.
In late June, Damascus said it would recognize the independence and sovereignty of Ukraines Russia-backed eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions, becoming the first country to recognize the two breakaway states independence. That led Ukraine to sever ties with Syria.
It said that Ukraine had in reality ruptured relations with Syria in 2018, when it refused to revalidate residencies of Syrian diplomatic staff in Kyiv, making it impossible for them to carry out their duties. It said that the Syrian embassy at that time suspended its duties as a result of the hostile attitudes of the Ukrainian government.
The Syrian Arab Republic has decided to break diplomatic relations with Ukraine in conformity with the principle of reciprocity, a Syrian Foreign Ministry statement said.
Syria said Wednesday it is formally breaking diplomatic ties with Ukraine in response to a similar move by Kyiv.
