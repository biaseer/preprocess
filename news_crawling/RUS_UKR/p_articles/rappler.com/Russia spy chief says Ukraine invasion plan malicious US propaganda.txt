I need to reassure everyone. Nothing like this is going to happen, Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russias foreign intelligence agency, said in an interview broadcast on state television, referring to comments on Russias alleged invasion plans.
While US officials have voiced concerns about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine, Moscow has accused Washington, Kyiv, and NATO of provocative and irresponsible behavior near its borders. Rappler.com
Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine and suggestions to the contrary are malicious US propaganda, Moscows foreign intelligence chief said on Saturday, November 27.
Everything that is happening around this topic right now is of course malicious propaganda by the US State Department.
Russia has repeatedly said it is free to move its troops on its own territory and that such movements should not be a cause for concern.

US, NATO, and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements near the border with Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch an attack.
Naryshkin spoke a day after the State Departments top US diplomat for European affairs said all options were on the table in how to respond to Russias troop buildup near Ukraines border and that NATO would decide on the next move after consultations next week.
