The Russian delegation in Brussels was led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin. On NATOs behalf, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and permanent representatives of the alliances 30 member states took part in the Brussels talks.
"I believe that we managed to bring to the notice of the alliances members that the situation was turning intolerable and that at some moment the risks related to the continuation of NATOs present policy might outweigh the advantages that they seek to derive today from the traditional NATO rhetoric that the future security in Europe and the Euro-Atlantic region must be NATO-centered and that eventually European security will consist of the NATO global map, with NATO at the center, a partnership, all playing by the rules elaborated in Brussels," the senior Russian diplomat said.
BRUSSELS, January 12. TASS. Russia expects to get out of the crisis in relations with NATO through a balance of interests, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said at a press conference after a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council on Wednesday.
As the diplomat reiterated, NATOs further expansion was associated with serious risks for European security.
The talks at the Russia-NATO Council in Brussels marked the second stage of consultations between Russia and Western countries on Russias proposals on European security. The meeting is a follow-up to the negotiations between Russia and the United States held in Geneva on January 10. Also, a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council will take place in Vienna on January 13.
"We also proceed from the fact that the rational interests of strengthening European security require a clear understanding that the alliances further expansion is associated with risks that will outweigh any decision on further expansion," Grushko stressed.
"I believe that many have come to realize today that this story will sooner or later come to an end and it may look differently. We favor exiting this situation, using peaceful means, on the basis of a reasonable balance again," he added.
