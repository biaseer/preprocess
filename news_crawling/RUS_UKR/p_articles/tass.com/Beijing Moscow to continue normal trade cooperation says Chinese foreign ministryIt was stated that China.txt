BEIJING, March 1. TASS. China and Russia will continue normal mutually beneficial trade cooperation, Chinas Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a briefing on Tuesday when asked whether sanctions slapped on Russia would trigger the growth of Russias demand for Chinese imports, as well as increase the role of yuan in bilateral trade.
