The official noted that Yanukovich "was not the most popular Ukrainian leader" and therefore he "would have likely lost the elections which were initially supposed to take place in 2015 TASS." "If any more pro-Western leader came after him, he would have signed all the necessary documents on the association between Ukraine and the EU," he added.
"Ukrainians could have been well developing their relations with the European Union, we never opposed that. It seems to me that Ukraine just fell victim to a primitively understood policy of conducting quick democratic transformations with the use of color revolution technologies," said Medvedev, who served as Russian prime minister back in 2014.
MOSCOW, September 17. TASS.
