"No, he Biden - TASS did not propose it to me. But I will tell you frankly, it was not brought up in principle, and if, for example, you take French President Emmanuel Macrons opinion, he constantly confirms that it is necessary to do everything so that Ukraine is not left alone with the separatists," he said.
Moscow has reiterated that the conflict in Donbass is intra-Ukrainian, while Russia acts as a mediator in its settlement within the framework of the Minsk agreements, as well as the OSCE, France, and Germany.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 22 said in reply to Zelenskys proposal for a personal meeting that if the problems of Donbass were to be discussed, the Ukrainian leadership should meet with the leaders of the Lugansk and Donetsk peoples republics in the first place. Putin believes this should be the first step to be taken towards a settlement in Donbass, while discussions on these issues with any third parties, including Russia, might follow only afterwards. He stressed that he would be prepared to receive Zelensky in Moscow at any convenient moment, if the development of bilateral relations was to be considered.
