LONDON, January 25.TASS. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that he was prepared to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin once again to discuss the situation in Ukraine.
"My Right Honorable Friends the Foreign and Defense Secretaries have both conveyed the same message to President Putin and I am prepared of course to speak, ready to speak to him again," Boris Johnson said, reiterating that he had a phone call with the Russian leader on December 13.
"The truth is that if Russias goal is to keep NATO forces away from her borders, then if that is Russias goal, then invading Ukraine could scarcely be more counter-productive," the prime minister said as he gave a statement on the situation in Ukraine to the House of Commons.
