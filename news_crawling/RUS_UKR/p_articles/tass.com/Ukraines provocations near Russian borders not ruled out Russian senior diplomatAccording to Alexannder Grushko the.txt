"If the Kiev authorities refuse to implement the Mink agreements, if we see never-ending violations of the ceasefire agreement, if we look at the violations statistics - around 87 in the territories of the LPR and DPR Lugansk and Donetsk Peoples Republics - TASS and 13 in the corridor controlled by the central government, it becomes clear who is responsible and who is being shelled. No double-entry bookkeeping - everything is reflected in the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission," he stressed.
MOSCOW, November 29. TASS. Moscow doesnt rule out Kievs provocations near the borders with Russia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said on Monday.
