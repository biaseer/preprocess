MOSCOW, July 5. TASS. Russia will not recognize the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly declaration, which the US, Ukraine and Lithuania offered to include language about Russias "aggressive war" and "threat for OSCE" to, head of the Russian delegation to the organization Pyotr Tolstoy said.
"The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly wraps up its work in Birmingham today, which took place without Russias participation.  In the absence of Russia, the main topic was of course, Russia. For example, the US, Ukraine and Lithuania proposed to include language about Russias aggressive war and threat for the OSCE to the outcome declaration.  However, we are not going to recognize any of it, at least because we were stripped of an opportunity to take part in the discussion," Tolstoy said on his Telegram channel Tuesday.
