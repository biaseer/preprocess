As at 15 March, around 2,500 Ukrainian refugees had applied to register for Luxembourg's temporary protection scheme, which provides access tohealthcare, jobs and schooling, Foreign Affairs Minister Jean Asselborn said in an interview on RTL Radio at the time. Others are being housed directly by residents.
Protestors gathered in Luxembourgs capital on Saturday afternoon to demonstrate against the continued Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Russia started invading its western neighbour just over a month ago, forcing around 10 million people  mainly women and children  to flee their homes. Mostly left to other areas within their country and around 3.5 million have crossed the border, the UN refugee agency said this week.
Another protest targeted Gazprombankwhich acts as a conduit for Russias oil and gas exports but which the West has not yet sanctioned.
Adults and children carried the Ukrainian flag and placards with slogans which read Stop Putin, Stop War, Putler, hands off Ukraine and How many more people need to die?.
The Russian military said on Friday it was focusing efforts on taking full control of Ukraines Donbas region, potentially a sign it is backing away from hopes of taking larger swathes of the country.
A number of previous protests have also taken place on Place Clairefontaine, not far from Prime Minister Xavier Bettel's office, in Luxembourg City. Earlier this week, Russia's embassy became the target of anti-war protesters, who sprayed the words "KILL PUTIN" on the walls of the embassy, which is housed in an opulent chteauin Dommeldange, just north of the capital.
