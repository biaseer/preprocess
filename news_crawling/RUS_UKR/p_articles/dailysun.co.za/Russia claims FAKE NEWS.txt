Thats how fake news is born, Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russias first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, claimed on Twitter on Thursday, 10 March.
Russias war in Ukraine has entered its third week with none of its stated objectives reached despite thousands of people killed, more than two million made refugees, and thousands forced to cower in besieged cities under relentless bombardment.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of carrying out genocide after the Russian aircraft attack, which on Wednesday buried patients in rubble despite a ceasefire deal for people to flee Mariupol.
Polyanskiy claimed Russia had warned on 7 March that the hospital had been turned into a military object from which Ukrainians were firing.
What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, is afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them? Zelenskyy said in a televised address late on Wednesday.
KYIV, UKRAINE RUSSIA has denied bombing a childrens hospital in Mariupol and said the claims were fake news, alleging it was a former maternity hospital that had long been taken over by troops.
Moscows stated objectives of crushing the Ukrainian military and ousting the pro-West elected government of President Zelenskyy remained out of reach, with Zelenskyy unshaken and Western military aid pouring across the Polish and Romanian borders.
The United Kingdom Defence Ministry said on Thursday that a large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made little progress in over a week and was suffering continued losses.
