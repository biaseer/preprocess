BETHESDA, Maryland: Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Officer James Taiclet said plans call to nearly double its production of Javelin anti-tank missiles, which have helped Ukraine counter Russia's invasion, as reported by CBS News.Taiclet added that the aim is to increase output to 4,000 missiles per year from the current level of 2,100.In an effort to press Congress to approve his proposed $33 billion assistance package for Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden visited a Lockheed facility in Alabama last week that manufactures the missiles jointly by Lockheed and Raytheon Technologies.Since the start of the Russian invasion on 24th February, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with weapons worth $3.4 billion, including Javelins, howitzers, Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, ammunition and body armor."We can start turning up the heat now and ramping up production immediately. We are planning for the long run and not just in the Javelin," Taiclet said.The firm is anticipating increased demand for "superior systems in large enough numbers," he added, noting that he expects to see increased demand beyond the Ukraine war, due to the threats posed by Russia and China.
