MOSCOW, Russia: The Russian reseller of children's toy company Lego said it was temporarily "freezing" some of its stores in Russia, as its shelves have been emptied by sanctions imposed on Moscow after its February invasion of Ukraine.In an email to clients seen by Reuters, the local reseller said, "Supplies of Lego in Russia have been temporarily suspended, and we continue to operate only on local stocks. In connection with this, we are temporarily freezing the work of some stores."In March, Lego, which has 81 stores in Russia which are operated by Inventive Retail Group, said it was pausing shipments to Russia due to the severe disruption caused by the Ukraine war.
