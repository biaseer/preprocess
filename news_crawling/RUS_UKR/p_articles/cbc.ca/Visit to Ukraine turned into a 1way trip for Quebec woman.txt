Dronova is not naming the city she is currently staying in forsafety reasons, but she plans on being in Ukraine for as long as she can help.
"We cried our eyes out during those days, mourning our friends, mourning our people all around the country."
In response to Russia's attack on Ukraine, Canada has imposed measures that are meant to hobble Russia's economy.
Dronova, who's lived in Canada for two years, flew back to Ukraine five days before the Russian invasion to mourn her mother who passed away due to COVID-19 complications.
As the war ramped up, she decided to stay behind to help her people. One of those ways is calling for more support to help end the war.
"As long as Ukraine is fighting, Canada and other countries should help as much as possible financially, militarily, politically, in all ways possible," said Dronova.
Dronova wants a no-fly zone over Ukraine, adding they need "more ammunition" and more "defence systems."
NATO has refused to impose a no-fly zone to prevent the war from escalating beyond Ukraine.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in an invasion on Feb. 24. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance andWestern governmentshaveimposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.
"We understand neither NATO nor other countries are ready to help us to cover the skies, so we have to do it by ourselves," she said.
"We could see so many people dying and so many cities bombed and shelled with missiles," said Dronova, a permanent Canadian resident from Ukraine living in Gatineau, Que.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a desperate plea to Canada's House of Commonslast week calling for the West to close the skies above Ukraine.
