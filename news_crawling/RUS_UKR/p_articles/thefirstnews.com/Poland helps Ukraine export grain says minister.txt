Ukraine's inability to export grain via its ports owing to the Russian invasion has increased the risk of global food insecurity, and helped drive up food prices around the world.
The minister said the grain is being transported by road and rail, with the latter being more important.
Poland has been helping Ukraine export its grain after Russia cut off Ukraines usual export routes through its Black Sea ports, Henryk Kowalczyk, Poland's agriculture minister, has said.
"We have to reload the cargo, or re-set the rail cars, so it is a bottleneck," the minister said.
"First of all, the transports are already taking place," Kowalczyk told the private radio RMF FM on Thursday.
"This is why the European Commission EC has shown interest and offered help," Kowalczyk said, adding that the EC "may provide rail cars and means of transport from other countries."
The main problem is the difference in rail gauges between Poland and Ukraine, Kowalczyk said.
