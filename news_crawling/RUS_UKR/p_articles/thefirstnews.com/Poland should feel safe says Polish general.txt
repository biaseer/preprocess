Vladimir Putin will lack the capability to undertake any "military adventures" for the next five years, so Poland should feel "safe," a former commander of Polands ground forces has told PAP.
Assessing the report, Gen Waldemar Skrzypczak, the former commander of Poland's ground forces, told PAP: "Putin is incapable of starting any military battles with anyone and will not be able to do so for the next five years  Poland can feel safe."
He added that "the intentions of the Russians have ended in failure" and that the army "has suffered a disastrous defeat."
