"We will never allow this as we want Poland to be an independent country, because we want to defend our homeland, and because we know how to do this," Minister Baszczak said on Sunday in Wolica Sniatycka, eastern Poland.
Referring to the ongoing war in Ukraine, Baszczak said that during his visit to Irpin, near Kyiv, he had seen "the consequences of the Russian invasion."
Baszczak made the statement during the unveiling of a monument which commemorates the Battle of Komarw, one of the most important battles of the Polish-Soviet War, in which Polish-Ukrainian forces defeated the Russian cavalry on August 31, 1920 and prevented the westward expansion of the Bolsheviks.
The Polish defence minister said, on Sunday, that Poland would never allow Russia to occupy "even an inch" of its soil.
"Remembrance and perseverance in developing and strengthening the Polish army are the response to these threats," the minister concluded.
