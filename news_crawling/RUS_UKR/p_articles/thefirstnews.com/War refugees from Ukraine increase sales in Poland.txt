"...this can result in a growing trend in retail trade provided war refugees have enough financial means at their disposal," Robert Kozielski from d University told the daily, adding that these funds could come from the state budget, local governments or from a refugees own resources.
According to an expert quoted by the paper, a similar increase is likely to be reported in the sales of clothes, footwear and cosmetics.
"This has already found reflection in the sales of basic foodstuffs, which are also being sent in humanitarian convoys to war-hit areas in Ukraine," the daily said.
"In the long run, such a huge inflow of people will surely have an impact on the entire retail sector, which has been getting ready for this scenario," the daily reported, adding that the expected growth in sales of basic foodstuffs was likely to reach PLN 2-3 billion EUR 435-652 million a month.
Since February 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine, over 2.4 million people have crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border into Poland.
The Polish retail sector could get a boost owing to increased demand for foodstuffs and other products caused by the huge number of refugees from Ukraine now in Poland, the newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported on Friday.
