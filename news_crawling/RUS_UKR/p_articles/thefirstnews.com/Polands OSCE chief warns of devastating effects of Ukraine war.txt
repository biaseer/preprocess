Rau was speaking as he opened the Second Preparatory Meeting of the 30th OSCE Economic and Environmental Forum on Monday, a two-day conference in Lodz, central Poland.
The main topic of the forum is "promoting security and stability in the OSCE area through sustainable economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic," according to the organisers.
According to the OSCE head, Russia's war on Ukraine has a "destabilising effect" on the world's economy and increases environmental and climate risks.
According to OSCE chief, the longer the situation continues the more its impact will be felt on generations to come.
"And the economic and environmental outlook for the country is dire and likely to get even worse," he said.
Among other "serious risks that must be urgently addressed," Rau mentioned deteriorating nuclear safety, food insecurity and unstable energy and commodity markets.
He pointed out that the war had "deeply shaken" financial markets, including those from the OSCE area, that are yet to fully recover from the pandemic.
According to international estimates, cited by Rau, Ukraine has lost around one third of its workforce as a result of the war.
"Havoc and destruction dominate wherever Russia's troops engage," he said, pointing to the "devastating" consequences of the war on Ukraine's economy.
OSCE Secretary-General Helga Schmid and environmental policy makers from more than 50 countries are expected to attend the event.
Zbigniew Rau, Poland's foreign minister and the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe OSCE, has said the consequences of Russia's war on Ukraine are devastating for the global economy and climate.
"Land, water and air pollution caused by unlawful military activity poses direct risks to the health of citizens," Rau continued.
