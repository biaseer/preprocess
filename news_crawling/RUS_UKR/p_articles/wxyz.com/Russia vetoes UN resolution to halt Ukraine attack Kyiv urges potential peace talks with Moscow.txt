Fridays vote was 11-1, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. It showed significant but not total opposition to Russias invasion of its smaller, militarily weaker neighbor.
As Bloomberg reported, Ukraine's government announced on Friday that it was in talks with Russia regarding a time and location to carry out potential peace talks, as ground fighting in Ukraine continues with Russian forces closing in on Ukraine's capital city Kyiv.
The United States and other supporters knew the resolution wouldnt pass but argued it would highlight Russias international isolation. The resolutions failure paves the way for backers to call for a swift vote on a similar measure in the U.N. General Assembly. There are no vetoes in the 193-member assembly. Theres no timetable as yet for a potential Assembly vote.
Russia has vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops.
