Russian forces attacked western Ukraine for the first time, launching strikes on airfields, and thus widening the two-and-a-half-week war. Russia also hit a major industrial city in the east, as it continued its brutal campaign, while U.S. officials said Russia is making incremental advances toward Kyiv. NewsHour's foreign affairs correspondent Nick Schifrin reports from the western city of Lviv.
