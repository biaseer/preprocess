The Pentagon said Wednesday that Russia is 80-percent prepared for a full invasion of Ukraine. That word came as Ukraine put in force a state of emergency, and Moscow said the separatists that Russia backs in eastern Ukraine had asked for Russian military help to fend off what they call "Ukrainian aggression."
