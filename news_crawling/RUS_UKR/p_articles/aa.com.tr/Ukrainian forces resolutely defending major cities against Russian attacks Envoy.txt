He said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has refused to be evacuated from the besieged capital Kyiv and continues to lead our country and our defense.

All people living in Ukraine are suffering due to this war. This is World War III, not just a war against Ukraine, Bodnar asserted.

Zelenskyy has accused Moscow of trying to install a puppet government, vowing that Ukrainians will defend their country against Russian aggression.
The enemy is trying to capture our big cities. We have withstood all these attacks, Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said at an event in the Turkish capital Ankara.
For centuries, they Russia have tortured their neighbors, occupied their land, and now we are standing up to them, he said.
Ukrainian forces are resolutely defending all major cities from Russian attacks, Ukraines envoy to Turkiye said on Saturday.
He said the Ukrainian Embassy will open a bank account in Turkiye for people to send donations for those impacted by the war in Ukraine.
Fighting on the third day of the attack is said to have reached the streets of Kyiv.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation in Ukraine on Thursday, days after recognizing two separatist-held enclaves in eastern Ukraine.
In a televised address, Putin said the people of Donbas asked Russia for help, claiming that he wanted to "demilitarize" and "denazify" Ukraine.
