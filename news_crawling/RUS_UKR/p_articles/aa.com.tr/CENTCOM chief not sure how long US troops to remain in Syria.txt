Commander of US Central Command CENTCOM, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., said he is not sure how long US troops will remain in Syria.
The CENTCOM chief said the US principal task in Syria is to complete the defeat of DaeshISIS to support the Syrian Democratic Forces SDF, a rebranded version of the YPGPKK terror group, to root out and pressure the remaining holdouts of DaeshISIS.
That's just not known to me. Ultimately, that'll be a policy decision that'll be made by national leadership of the United States as we go forward, based on the situation on the ground, he added.
McKenzie said there is no evidence that Russia plans to escalate the situation in Syria in response US assistance to Ukraine.
I think they probably have plans to do that -- I'm just guessing they do I don't know that -- but they have not chosen to do so, he said.
I don't know how long we're going to remain in Syria, General McKenzie said in a briefing to reporters late Friday.
He added, We see no evidence that Russia intends to escalate in Iraq or Syria, but of course we will be prepared for that should that eventuality come about.
