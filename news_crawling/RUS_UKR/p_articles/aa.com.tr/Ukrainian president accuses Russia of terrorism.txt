Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday slammed Russia for its calculated" airstrikes on a shopping center in the city of Kremenchuk, saying it was an act of terrorism.
The Russian state has become the largest terrorist organization in the world. And this is a fact. And this must be a legal fact, he said.
He added: Everyone in the world must know that buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining contacts with Russian banks, paying taxes and customs duties to the Russian state means giving money to terrorists.
Over a dozen people were reportedly killed and as many injured after Russia hit a busy shopping center.
More than 4,634 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the war started on Feb. 24, according to the UN. More than 14 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including over 8 million that have fled to other countries, according to UN figures.
