Since late 2019, Lebanon has been grappling with a severe economic crisis, including a massive currency depreciation as well as fuel and medical shortages.
Banque du Liban is delaying the payment of wheat shipments for unknown reasons, he alleged.
Lebanon needs around 40,000-50,000 tons of wheat to meet the local market needs. The Arab country imports around 60 of its wheat needs from Ukraine and Russia, which launched a war on its neighbor in February.
The Lebanese currency has lost 90 of its value, eroding peoples ability to access basic goods, including food, water, healthcare, and education, while widespread power outages are common due to fuel shortages.
In a statement, the Bakeries Syndicate said bread bakeries face a shortage of wheat flour in several Lebanese areas.
A number of bakeries have stopped making bread, while others have limited quantities of wheat flour that are sufficient for only one day, it added.
Lebanons bakery union on Wednesday warned of a bread crisis in the Arab country as several wheat mills halted operation due to lack of funding.
