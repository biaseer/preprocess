He emphasized that Russia should believe and seek a peaceful resolution otherwise it will deal with economic sanctions.
Since Russia launched its war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, more than 2.5 million people have fled to other countries, with some 2 million more displaced within the country.
NATOs chief stressed Friday the alliances role in the Ukrainian resistance to ongoing Russian attacks during a speech delivered at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, of which Anadolu Agency is the global communications sponsor.
At least 564 civilians have also been killed and 982 others injured in Ukraine, according to UN estimates.
Referring to NATOs expansion that was presented as a major threat by Moscow, he noted that free countries, including Georgia, Ukraine, Sweden and Finland, have the right to make choices regarding their futures.
Support by many NATO members since 2014 to Ukrainian armed forces played a critical role in stopping the Russian attack, said Jens Stoltenberg.
While the EU, US and others have imposed sanctions on Moscow, many companies and global brands have also suspended operations in Russia.
