President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, addressing the U.S. Congress, said that Ukraine needs air defense systems and aircraft to repel Russian aggression.
At the same time, the head of state once again asked to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine, respectively, the conditions under which "Russia will no longer be able to terrorize peaceful cities every day and every night."
"Is this a big request? ... If it's too much, we offer an alternative. You know what kind of defense systems we need. S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the ability to use aircraft on the battlefield. Powerful aircraft. To protect your own people. Your freedom. Your land. Planes that can help Ukraine. What can help Europe. And you know they are. But on the ground. Not in the Ukrainian sky. They don't protect our people," he said.
"Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death. For a thousand people. Russian troops have already fired almost a thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless aerial bombs. They use drones to make it more efficient to kill. This is terror that Europe has not seen. Hasn't seen in 80 years! And we ask for a response," Zelensky said.
"Today I can say: I am in need. The need to protect our skies. The need for your decision. Your help," Zelensky concluded.
