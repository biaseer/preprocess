The European Court of Human Rights has decided to direct the Russian government to refrain from military attacks on the civilian population and civilian objects.
In addition, it is required to refrain from attacks on residential premises, ambulances and other specially protected civilian objects, such as schools and hospitals, and to immediately ensure the security of medical institutions, personnel and ambulances in the territory that was attacked or besieged by Russian troops.
Under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the Court may order interim measures to any state party to the European Convention on Human Rights. Interim measures are urgent measures which, according to the well-established practice of the Court, are applied only in cases where there is an imminent risk of irreparable harm.
