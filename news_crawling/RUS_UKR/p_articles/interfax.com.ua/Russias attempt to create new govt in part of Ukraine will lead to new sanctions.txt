"Most countries of the world will inevitably refuse Russian oil and other Russian energy. Not a single adequate country would want to invite Rosatom to cooperation," the president added.
"The longer and more brutal this war will be, the more resources will be spent not only by us, but also by the world to establish justice and punish all those responsible," he added.
According to him, the majority of Russians will have to pay with poverty for the aggressive policy of the leadership of their state. "And we will identify, find and bring to justice every war criminal and collaborator," Zelensky said.
"Russian troops are trying to present in Kherson and part of Zaporizhia region an allegedly new government. They are changing flags, demonstrating some kind of "suiciders" in the role of collaborators. And what does this give Russia? Only new losses. There will be a new sanctions package from the European Union, there will be even more restrictions on trade," Zelensky said in a video message on Wednesday night.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Russia's attempt to create a new government in Kherson and part of Zaporizhia regions of Ukraine will result in new sanctions.
"The time will come when Russia will have to admit that peace is needed," Zelensky said.
