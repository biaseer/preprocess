According to him, Russia two weeks ago withdrew tactical groups of airborne troops from Donetsk region and transferred them to the occupied Kherson. In addition, Russia is transferring troops from its eastern military district, which were used to attack Sloviansk.
"If Russia won, it would try to capture more territory. They are increasing their troop numbers, preparing for our counteroffensive in Ukraine's south and perhaps preparing to launch an offensive of their own. The south is key for them, above all because of Crimea," Skibitsky said.
"Russia is moving large numbers of troops to Ukraine's south for battles against the country's forces through the newly occupied territories and Crimea, according to Ukraine's deputy head of military intelligence," the press service of the Main Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defense said, citing Skibitsky in an interview with The Guardian.
