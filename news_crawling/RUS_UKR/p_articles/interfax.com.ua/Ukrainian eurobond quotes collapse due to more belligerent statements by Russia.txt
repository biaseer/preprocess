In addition, GDP warrants also fell in price by almost 7 on Thursday: now their price is about 80.3 of the face value - they have not been so cheap since the summer of 2019.
Falling prices of eurobonds maturing in 2024-2025 by 3.4-4.1 led to an increase in their profitability by almost 2 percentage points - to about 11.8 and 11.1, respectively.
Only the "longest" eurobonds maturing in 2032, although they lost in price more than others - almost 4.7, still retained the yield to maturity just below 10 per annum, emphasizing a pronounced inversion of the yield curve when rates on "short" papers are higher than for "long".
Rates on securities maturing in 2026-2027, which fell in price by about 4 on Thursday, also broke through the 10 level and now stand at about 10.7 and 10.2.
Eurobonds maturing in 2023 decreased in price by 2.9, which led to an increase in yields from about 10 to 12.2. As a result, now the rates of these dollar securities are higher than domestic government bonds with similar maturities.
More belligerent statements by Russian representatives led to a drop in Ukrainian eurobond quotes on Thursday by 2-4.7 depending on the maturity, as a result of which the rates to maturity of almost all bonds exceeded 10 per annum.
Market participants told the Interfax-Ukraine agency the price of the "shortest" securities this year lost 2, as a result of which the rate on them jumped from 10.6 to 14.25.
