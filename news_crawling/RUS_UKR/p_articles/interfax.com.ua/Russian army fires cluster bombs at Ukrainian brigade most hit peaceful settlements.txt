The ministry explained that one of the features of cluster munitions is that they can be in the ground for a long time and pose a danger long after the cessation of hostilities. It is from cluster munitions that a significant number of civilians, especially children, die after the end of wars.
"Cluster munitions air bombs, rockets, artillery or rockets are special means of destruction containing the same type of combat elements inside, including delayed-action mines scattered in the air over a large territory," Ukraine's Defense Ministry said on Telegram on Monday.
Russian multiple launch rocket systems MLRS with cluster bombs were used to attack the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, but most of the shells hit the area where peaceful settlements are located far beyond the line of fire, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have said.
"Fighters of the engineer-sapper battalion of the brigade have already begun to clear the area hit by Russian artillery cluster munitions," the Defense Ministry said.
