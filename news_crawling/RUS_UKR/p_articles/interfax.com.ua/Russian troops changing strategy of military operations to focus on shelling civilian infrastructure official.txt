"They understand that they are almost unable to do anything on land, in fact, in principle, now more than a third of the battalion tactical groups that entered the territory of Ukraine have been withdrawn from combat formation. And therefore they are switching to a strategy of shelling civilian infrastructure in the rear, far from the line front, and will continue to try to do such things," Denysenko explained on the air of the telethon on Monday.
He clarified that this strategy remains the only one that the Russian troops can implement in the current situation.
Russian troops will shift their main efforts to shelling Ukrainian civilian infrastructure far from the front line due to the lack of success in the ground operation, Vadym Denysenko, adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, believes.
"Unfortunately, this is their strategy and this is the only thing they can do now. That is, from their point of view, it's obvious, yes, raising the degree, they show that they will destroy infrastructure, because the number of missiles they still have is quite large. But in principle, they also understand that we continue to fight and we will fight," Denysenko stressed.
