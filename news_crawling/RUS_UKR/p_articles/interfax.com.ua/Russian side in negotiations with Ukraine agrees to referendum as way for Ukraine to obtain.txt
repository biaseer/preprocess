"The Russian side agreed that this would be the only way out of this situation," he said.
Asked what will happen if the transition to a neutral status is not supported by the people of Ukraine, Arakhamia said that "then the treaty will not have legal force and we will either return to a state of war, perhaps, or return to new negotiations."
The Russian side in negotiations with Ukraine has agreed that the referendum is the only way out in the process of recognizing the country's neutral status, David Arakhamia, head of the Ukrainian delegation at the talks, said during the telethon on Ukrainian television on Saturday.
