"Hello colleagues! I should refute statements that we have refused to hold talks. Ukraine has been ready and remains ready to discuss a ceasefire and peace. This is our permanent position. We responded by agreeing to the proposal of the president of the Russian Federation. The parties are in consultations on the venue and time of the negotiations during these hours," he said on Facebook on Friday evening.
Ukraine and Russia are holding consultations on the venue and time of talks, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhiy Nykyforov said.
He emphasized that "the sooner the negotiations begin, the more chances there will be to resume regular life."
