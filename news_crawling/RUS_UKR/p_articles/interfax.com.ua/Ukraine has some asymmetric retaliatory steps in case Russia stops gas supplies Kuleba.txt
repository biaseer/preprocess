"Russia has not yet cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. If the Kremlin decides to do so and destroy the remnants of its reputation as an energy supplier to Europe, we have a number of asymmetric retaliatory steps," Kuleba wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.
If Russia cuts gas supplies, Ukraine will take retaliatory measures, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said.
