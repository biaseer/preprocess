Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the world to take immediate action so that Russian barbarians stop the war against civilians and children in Ukraine.
"Russia continues holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues. Almost 3,000 newborn babies lack medicine and food. I urge the world to act! Force Russia to stop its barbaric war on civilians and babies!" Kuleba wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.
