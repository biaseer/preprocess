"We will rebuild the cities. The worst thing is that we will not return the dead people. There is nothing more precious than human life. And we will definitely rebuild everything else, we will rebuild it quickly," the head of the President's Office is convinced.
"The president already has a plan for economic revival on the table. We do not hesitate a day, we think and prepare for how we can start today. I think that cities will be restored immediately after they are liberated," Yermak said in an interview with the 11 TV channel.
Corruption, excessive bureaucracy and a bloated state apparatus should be a thing of the past, he said. The Ukrainian economy must become human-centric, and the state must guarantee justice.
Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak says that the restoration of Ukrainian cities will begin immediately after they are liberated from Russian occupiers, the website of the President's Office reported on Monday.
Yermak also supported the idea of creating a memorial to perpetuate all those who lost Ukraine in this war with the Russian occupiers.
