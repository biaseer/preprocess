The mayor said public utilities workers continue to perform their professional duties, and also help the humanitarian headquarters and volunteers. He said they are delivering grain to Kyivvkhlib and food and humanitarian aid to the people of Kyiv, as well as anti-tank barriers, cement blocks and sandbags for defensive barriers. He said all work is carried out only from 7:00 to 20:00, not when the curfew is in effect in Kyiv.
Explosions on Thursday night in Kyiv were associated with the work of air defense systems, which shot down several Russian missiles. There were no casualties or damage in the city, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said.
"The situation in the city is complicated, but under control. Several explosions rocked in the capital last night. It was the air defense systems of the Armed Forces that shot down enemy missiles. Thank God, there was no damage or casualties. Heating lines were damaged near the central train station as a result of a rocket strike Wednesday evening, but work is underway to repair them," Klitschko said on his Telegram channel on Thursday.
