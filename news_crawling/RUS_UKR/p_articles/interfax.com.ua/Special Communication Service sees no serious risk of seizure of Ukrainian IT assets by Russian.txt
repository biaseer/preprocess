"We mainly focus on moving data and backups. We respond quickly when Ukrainian IT assets are in serious danger to prevent possible data capture by Russian troops. But since most of our IT assets are located in Kyiv, we do not assess these risks as very high," deputy head of the service Viktor Zhora said during an online press conference on Wednesday, asked about the state of evacuation of state server capacities.
The State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection does not assess as "high" the risk of a possible seizure of data and Ukrainian IT assets by Russian troops.
He stressed that the process of moving state IT assets began even before the war, taking into account all possible risks, and continues to this day.
At the same time, he noted the procedure itself depends on the situation in each specific agency or company.
