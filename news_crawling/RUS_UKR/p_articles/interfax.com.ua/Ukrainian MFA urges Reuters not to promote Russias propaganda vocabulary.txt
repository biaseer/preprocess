"Reuters dont promote Russias propaganda vocabulary. Pro-Moscow Kherson region  Russian-occupied Kherson region. Grain exports  Stolen grain shipments. Military-Civilian Administration  Russian occupation administration. A footnote for Standards seems unconvincing," Nikolenko said on Twitter Monday.
Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Oleh Nikolenko has urged the British news agency Reuters not to promote the propaganda vocabulary of Russia.
