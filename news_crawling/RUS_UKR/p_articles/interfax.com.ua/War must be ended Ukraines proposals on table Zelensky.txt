President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that the war must be ended as soon as possible, otherwise Russia's losses will be such that several generations will not be enough for it to rise.
"Meaningful peace and security talks for Ukraine are Russia's only chance to reduce the harm from its own mistakes," Zelensky said in a video message on Saturday night.
"It's time to meet. It's time to speak. It's time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine," he stressed, adding that "otherwise Russia's losses will be such that even a few generations will not be enough for you to rise."
