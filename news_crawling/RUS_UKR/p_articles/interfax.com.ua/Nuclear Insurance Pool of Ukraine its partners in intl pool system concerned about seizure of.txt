The Nuclear Insurance Pool association receives letters from foreign nuclear insurance pools-partners with words of sincere support for Ukraine and anger towards Putin's barbarians.
The risks arising from the capture of Chornobyl nuclear power plant NPP by the Russian aggressor, the approach of its troops to the operating plants and the barbaric shelling of Kharkiv, although they do not have an insurance nature and coverage, cause serious concern for the world and the Ukrainian community, the Nuclear Insurance Pool of Ukraine association and its partners in the international pooling system, since they increase the likelihood of a nuclear incident.
"At the same time, we inform you that the Nuclear Insurance Pool of Ukraine association has no relations with the Nuclear Insurance Pool of Russia, the killer country. The reinsurance contract with the Nuclear Insurance Pool of Belarus is subject to termination in accordance with moral considerations and sanction requirements," the report says.
In a special information report of the Nuclear Insurance Pool of Ukraine association, published on the website of the Insurance Business association, it is also noted that Ukrainian insurers-members of the organization continue to be fully liable under contracts concluded with Energoatom and other insurers, relying on reliable reinsurance of partner pools.
The Nuclear Insurance Pool of Ukraine also referred to the data of Energoatom, according to which, as of March 2, 2022, all nuclear power plants in Ukraine produce electricity stably and safely for the needs of the population, industry and the army. Despite the martial law due to the full-scale aggression of Russia, there are no violations of the conditions for safe operation.
