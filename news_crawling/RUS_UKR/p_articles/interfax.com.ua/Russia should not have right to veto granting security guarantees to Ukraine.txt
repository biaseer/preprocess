Speaking about the guarantor countries, Arakhamia expressed the opinion that "nuclear states are important for us - France, the United States, China, as well as Germany and Turkey." "Five countries are very important for us, this is the minimum we are waiting for to say that this is a good framework to protect Ukraine from future aggression."
He said that "three NATO countries agreed in this format, this is actually Article 5 of NATO, but with a more stringent activation mechanism  Turkey, Germany and Italy."
According to him, "this is laid down in the mechanism for activating these guarantees. It seems to me that in the final round we will reach the fact that they will accept this position, otherwise we will not sign anything at all."
"We are discussing, they hear the logic, they understand that this cannot be so, therefore we are discussing a different format, where we have a peace treaty with Russia, and security guarantees are provided by other countries and Russia, of course, cannot block this process," Arakhamia also said.
"We insist that we will not sign any document where consensus is required, as in the UN Security Council. Then there is no need to discuss any security guarantees at all, Russia can block them at any moment," he said.
Ukraine believes that Russia should not have the right to veto the issue of providing Ukraine with security guarantees, David Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation at the talks, said on Saturday during a telethon on Ukrainian television on Saturday.
