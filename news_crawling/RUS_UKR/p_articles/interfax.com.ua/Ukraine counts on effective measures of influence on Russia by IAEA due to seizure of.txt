Ukraine counts on the adoption of effective measures to influence the country of the aggressor, the Russian Federation, by the IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency and other international organizations due to the seizure of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant NPP and the exclusion zone, head of the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, Oleh Korikov said.
According to the message, the military seizure of the Chornobyl NPP and the territory of the exclusion zone by Russian troops makes it impossible to fully fulfill Ukraine's obligations under the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Nuclear Fuel and Radioactive Waste Management, and the Agreement between Ukraine and the IAEA on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
"This situation calls into question the observance of international security regimes," the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine emphasized, calling it an unprecedented challenge that Ukraine faced, in particular, in terms of ensuring control over nuclear installations and other facilities for the use of nuclear energy on its territory.
"Ukraine is counting on effective support from the IAEA and other international organizations and the adoption of measures to influence the country of the aggressor," Korikov stressed during a telephone conversation with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, which was reported on the Facebook of the inspectorate on Saturday night.
