Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba welcomes the strengthening of the package of sanctions against the Russian Federation, but emphasizes that the measures taken are still not enough.
"I appreciate the strengthening of the 5th EU sanctions package: bans on Russian coal, vessels accessing EU ports, and road transport operators. But it will take a gasoil embargo and de-SWIFTing of all Russian banks to stop Putin. Difficult times require difficult decisions," Kuleba wrote on Twitter.
