The emphasizes that Russian aggression against Ukraine also spreading to Israel: Recently, alongside a notable propaganda attack on social media, we have witnessed anti-Ukrainian demonstrations funded by the Russian government. These demonstrations took place in Haifa, Netanya, and in front of the Ukrainian Embassy in Israel.
We are not shocked or surprised to see Russian funding directed at misleading the Israeli public. Despite the engineered demonstrations, we are aware that the Israeli public, for the most part, supports Ukraine and opposes the brutal Russian attacks, - Yevhen Korniychuk emphasized.
However, the ambassador of Ukraine notes that these efforts do not bring the expected effect.
The Israeli public mostly supports Ukraine and opposes Russian aggression, despite the increasing number of cases of Russian financing of anti-Ukrainian demonstrations in Israel. This was stated by the Ambassador of Ukraine to Israel Yevhen Korniychuk, according to the Embassy's Facebook page.
