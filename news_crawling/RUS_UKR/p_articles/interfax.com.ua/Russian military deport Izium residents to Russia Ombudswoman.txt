"Such treatment of civilians is a crime against humanity and a war crime, as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court," Denisova said.
"After bringing the city to a critical situation, the enemy offers a conditional corridor to the Russian Federation, ostensibly to save people, leaving people no choice," Denisova said.
"Residents of the temporarily occupied Izium in Kharkiv region are forcibly taken by Russian invaders to the territory of the Russian Federation. The enemy creates filtration camps and corridors through which they deport Ukrainian citizens to Russia," Denisova said on Telegram on Tuesday.
According to the Ukrainian ombudsman, the Russian side says 615,000 people have been taken out of Ukraine, of which 121,000 are children.
Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for Human Rights Liudmyla Denisova has reported the forced removal of residents of the temporarily occupied Izium, Kharkiv region, to cities in Russia.
She stressed that this was not the first time such tactics had been used by Russian troops.
