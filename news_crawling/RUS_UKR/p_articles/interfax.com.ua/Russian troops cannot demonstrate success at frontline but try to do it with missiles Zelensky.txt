"The 83rd day of our defense began with a rather serious combination of Russian strikes on Ukraine. Rocket fire on Lviv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, air strikes on Luhansk region. Specific sabotage activity in the border regions of Ukraine. All this is not just an attempt to create tension for our state, not just a test of our strength, this is, in a way, an attempt to compensate the Russian army for a series of failures in the east and south of our state," Zelensky said in a video message on Wednesday night.
"They cannot demonstrate success by combined arms actions in those areas where they are trying to attack. Therefore, they are trying to show success through their missiles and other activities. But also without results," he said.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops cannot demonstrate success at the frontline, so they are trying to compensate for it with missiles.
According to him, these missile strikes, like the previous ones, do not fundamentally change anything. "Moreover, our air defense and anti-sabotage measures are getting stronger," the head of state said.
