"After what the world saw in Bucha, sanctions against Russia must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers' war crimes. If after that Russian banks will still be able to function as usual... If after that the transit of goods to Russia will continue as usual... If after that the EU countries will pay for Russian energy resources as usualThen the political fate of some leaders will develop not as usual," he said in a video address late on Tuesday.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has said that sanctions against Russia should be commensurate with the war crimes committed by it.
"Now is a crucial moment, especially for Western leaders," Zelensky said, adding that "this is about how decisions on sanctions will be assessed in Western societies themselves My advice to everyone: feel now that the moment is really crucial," he said.
