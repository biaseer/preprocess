"They also discussed their respective diplomatic engagements and their coordinated efforts to continue to impose severe economic costs to hold Russia accountable," the White House spokeswoman said. She said that the leaders agreed to continue to closely coordinate their efforts, including working with and through the G7, EU, and NATO.
"There could be I think that we're still doing considerations and running a process for additional sanctions, but there are some under consideration, yes," she said, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States could announce additional sanctions against Russia this week.
The leaders reiterated their commitment to continue providing security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in its time of need.
