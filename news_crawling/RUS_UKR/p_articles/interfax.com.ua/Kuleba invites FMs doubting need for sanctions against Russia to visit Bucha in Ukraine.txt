"If you have doubts, unwillingness or arguments about the need to continue business with Russia, first visit Bucha, and then talk to me," Kuleba added.
"The more weapons we have, the faster we can win this war and prevent Russia from committing even greater crimes," the minister said.
He stressed that he is addressing this appeal to all foreign ministers who will meet this week in NATO, in the EU, at the G7 ministerial meeting.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged foreign ministers who doubt the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia to visit Bucha and see the crimes committed by the Russian military.
"I invite international representatives, my colleagues, those who still have doubts whether to disconnect Russian banks from SWIFT or whether to continue buying Russian gas, oil and coal, or whether to receive Russian ships in ports and process products sold to Russia or bought from Russia, visit Bucha immediately, visit a small town and stand in front of a mass grave, see the bodies of dead Ukrainian women who were raped before they were killed and whom the Russians tried to burn to hide the traces of their crimes," Kuleba said at a press conference with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in Warsaw on Monday.
