The World Nuclear Association WNA has strongly condemned the direct attack by the Russian armed forces on Zaporizhia nuclear power plant and called for the creation of safe zones for Ukraine's nuclear power plants.
As reported, Ukraine asked the IAEA to apply to NATO with a demand to close access to the airspace over its nuclear facilities, that is, to introduce an A2AD zone Anti AccessArea Denial, prohibition of accessclosure of the territory and to intensify actions to prevent acts of terrorism immediately after the capture by the Russian troops of the Chornobyl zone.
"We continue to monitor the situation and are working very closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA and other national and international interested parties," the association said.
"We strongly urge the creation of safe zones around all nuclear power plants in Ukraine to ensure the safety of all nuclear facilities and their personnel," the association said in a statement on its website on Friday.
In addition, the WNA called for an end to all violence at all nuclear facilities, as well as allowing plant workers and emergency response teams to carry out their duties.
