The talks with Russia have not brought the results desired by Ukraine just yet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Monday night.
"There is no result desired by us just yet. Russia declared its position, and we made an argument in order to stop the war. We received certain signals. When the delegation returns to Kyiv, we will analyze what we have heard and will decide how to proceed to the second round of negotiations," Zelensky said.
