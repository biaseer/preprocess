EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell sees the risk of a "grain war" that, in his opinion, will affect not only Ukraine, but also the most vulnerable countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
He said if this agreement between the UN and Russia is reached, the European Union will be ready to take part in the implementation of this decision.
During the May 30-31 EU summit in Brussels, President of the European Council Charles Michel said that the EU supports UN efforts to find a solution to free up a sea corridor in the Black Sea for the export of Ukrainian wheat stocks.
He assured that the European Union will do everything in its power, even take part in any mission of the navy, if there is an agreement between Russia and the UN on the export of Ukrainian wheat.
"The EU is taking urgent action to facilitate food and agriculture exports from Ukraine, stepping up transport infrastructure and we are strongly supporting UN efforts to unblock the Black Sea route and coordinate to ensure a comprehensive global food security response," he said during his visit to Jordan.
