"We already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who can either be deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate. The situation now is such that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite observation of events on the ground, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth, we will find out all the circumstances regarding most of our missing citizens," he said.
"As for the majority of Russian war crimes on the territory of Ukraine: if the world has started a discussion about whether it is permissible to call what the Russian military did on the territory of Ukraine a genocide, then the search for the truth can no longer be stopped. It is no longer 'roll back' in any way. It is only possible to quickly abandon further aggression against Ukraine and thereby try to at least somehow reduce the damage to Russian statehood and to those who personally make key decisions in Russia. If not, if nothing changes, then it is suicide. Suicide for everyone who chooses the option of continuing the war," Zelensky said in a video message on Thursday night.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that the continuation of the war in Ukraine would be suicidal for the Russian authorities.
He stressed that the military-political leadership of the Russian Federation will not be able to avoid responsibility.
"We have information that the Russian military has changed tactics and is trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements in the occupied territories. This is only an attempt to hide evidence and nothing more. But they will not succeed, because a lot have been killed," the head of state said.
