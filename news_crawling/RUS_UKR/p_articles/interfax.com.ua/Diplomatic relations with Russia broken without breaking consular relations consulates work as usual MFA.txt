The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine also recalled Charg d'Affaires of Ukraine in the Russian Federation Vasyl Pokotylo to Kyiv for consultations and proceeded to evacuate the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow.
Consular offices of Ukraine on the territory of the Russian Federation continue to work as usual.
"Our state took such a step in response to the act of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the invasion of Russian troops to destroy the Ukrainian state, seize Ukrainian territory by force and establish occupation control," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, on behalf of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, has begun the procedure for breaking off diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
The ministry noted that the Russian offensive operation is an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, a gross violation of the UN Charter and the fundamental norms and principles of international law.
"Ukraine declares the severance of diplomatic relations with Russia without severing consular relations, in accordance with Article 2 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963. We will continue to protect the rights and interests of Ukrainians in Russia, including Ukrainian political prisoners," the statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine said.
