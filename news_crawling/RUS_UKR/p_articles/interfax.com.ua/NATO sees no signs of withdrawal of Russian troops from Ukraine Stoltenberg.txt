"There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy could continue. But so far, we have not seen any sign of withdrawal or de-escalation," Stoltenberg said.
NATO still does not see signs of the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and continues to monitor the situation around the border, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference on Thursday.
