"We did not ask for anything special from the official Budapest. We didn't even get what everyone else is doing! They are doing it for peace. We did not receive the vital transit of defense assistance, we did not see moral leadership. We did not see a single effort to stop the war!" Zelensky said.
Ukraine has not seen a single effort from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to stop the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
"Politicians are leaving. But the truth remains. That's what I'm talking about  the truth. And I always say what I think. When I talk about Hungary, I mean Hungary. And I don't need to mask my thoughts. If it's a war, I call it a war, not a "special operation." If this is a threat to the entire Europe, then I call it a threat to the entire Europe. This is called honesty, which Mr. Orban lacks. Perhaps he lost it somewhere in contacts with Moscow," the President of Ukraine said.
"The entire Europe is trying to stop the war, to restore peace. Why, then, is official Budapest opposed to the whole of Europe, to all civilized countries? For what?" the Ukrainian president asked. According to him, "the Ukrainian people support the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people support the Ukrainian people. We still value peace, we still value freedom. So it will always be. We will always live in good neighborliness."
He called Orban "a man who doesn't seem to fully understand what is going on and what is being experienced, not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe," as well as that who "is almost the only one in Europe who openly support Mr. Putin."
