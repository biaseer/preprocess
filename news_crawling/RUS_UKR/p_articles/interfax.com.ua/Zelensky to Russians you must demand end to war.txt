"If for the war, you will forever be outcasts for the rest of your life and you will lose everything in the end. And if for peace, if you have at least a little shame for what Russian troops are doing in Ukraine, then now is a key moment for such citizens of Russia," he said in a video message on the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky called on the Russians to demand an end to the war in Ukraine and the withdrawal of Russian troops and to decide whether they are for war or for peace.
According to him, "this also applies to ordinary citizens. Nazism has no future, mass murder has no future. Everyone in Russia who does not demand an end to the shameful war has no future."
"It is necessary to demand precisely an end to the war. Demanding peace, it is better to lose something, to face the Russian repressive machine, than if you are equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life," Zelensky said.
