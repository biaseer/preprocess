On Sweden's and Finland's plans to join NATO, Matviyenko said Russia will take corresponding measures if NATO weapons and equipment appear in the two countries, and Russia is capable of guaranteeing its own security.
Russia is also a major gas supplier to Europe, where potential supply disruptions are seen as hitting power-intensive aluminum and zinc graphite powder are still very uncertain.
Matviyenko also noted that Europe currently lacks politicians who can make independent decisions. She said the EU's strategy to wean itself off Russian energy by 2027 would be costly, with Russia supplying 40 percent of Europe's gas, 27 percent of its oil, and 46 percent of its coal, and was essentially "anti-European" and a "tax" on US global dominance.
At an earlier time, the West imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which aroused concerns about the supply problem because Russia is a major producer of nickel, aluminum, and copper.
Natural graphite is mainly used in refractories, batteries, steelmaking, expanded graphite, brake pads, casting surfaces and lubricants.Refractory materialThe use of graphite as a refractory heat-resistant material began before 1900 as a graphite crucible for holding molten metal this is a small part of today's refractories. In the mid-1980s, carbon-magnesia bricks became important, followed by alumina-graphite shapes. As of 2017, the order of importance is alumina-graphite profiles, carbon-magnesite bricks, Monolithics gunning and tamping mixtures, and then crucibles.The crucible begins to use very large flake graphite, while carbon-magnesia bricks do not need that large flake graphite for these and other aspects, the sheet size required is now more flexible, and amorphous graphite is no longer limited to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite profiles are used as continuous castings, such as nozzles and grooves, to transport molten steel from the ladle to the mold, and magnesia bricks are arranged in converters and electric arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite blocks are also used in blast furnace lining components, in which the high thermal conductivity of graphite is very important to ensure the full cooling of the furnace bottom and furnace. High purity monoliths are usually used as continuous lining rather than carbon-magnesia bricks.BatteryThe use of graphite in batteries has increased since the 1970s. Natural and synthetic graphite are used as anode materials for the construction of electrodes in major battery technologies.Demand for batteries, mainly Ni-MH and Li-ion batteries, led to an increase in demand for graphite in the late 1980s and early 1990s-an increase driven by portable electronic devices, such as portable CD players and power tools. Laptops, mobile phones, tablets and smartphones have increased the demand for batteries. Electric vehicle batteries are expected to increase demand for graphite. For example, the lithium-ion battery in the all-electric Nissan leaf contains nearly 40 kilograms of graphite.Radioactive graphite from old nuclear reactors is being studied as fuel. Nuclear diamond batteries have the potential to provide long-term energy for electronic products and the Internet of things.SteelmakingThe natural graphite in steelmaking is mainly used to increase the carbon content in molten steel it can also be used to lubricate dies used for extruding hot steel. Carbon additives face competitive prices from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder, petroleum coke and other forms of carbon. A carburizer is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to a specified level.Brake padsNatural amorphous and fine flake graphite is used for brake linings or brake shoes of heavier non-automotive vehicles and becomes important as an alternative to asbestos is needed. This use has been important for a long time, but non-asbestos organic NAO components began to reduce the market share of graphite.Casting surface and lubricantThe mold cleaning solution for casting is a kind of waterborne amorphous or fine flake graphite coating. Use it to paint the inside of the mold and let it dry, leaving a fine graphite coating to ease the separation of the casting after the hot metal cools. Graphite lubricant is a special product used at very high or very low temperatures. It is used as forging die lubricant, anti-jamming agent, gear lubricant for mining machinery and lubricating locks. There is a great need for low-grained graphite or even better non-grained graphite ultra-high purity. It can be used as dry powder in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite permanent suspension in liquid. The metal can also be impregnated into graphite to form a self-lubricating alloy for applications in extreme conditions, such as machine bearings exposed to high or low temperatures.PencilSince the 16th century, all pencils have been made of English natural graphite, but the most common modern pencil lead is a mixture of powdered graphite and clay. It was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Cont  in 1795.Today, pencils are still a small and important market for natural graphite. About 7 per cent of the 1.1 million tonnes produced in 2011 was used to make pencils. The use of inferior amorphous graphite is mainly from China.Pine derbyGraphite is probably the most commonly used lubricant in pine derby.HeadsetGraphene is used to make 40mm acoustic drivers that transmit sound to the ear. A dynamic driver, also known as a moving coil driver, uses an electric voice coil to move the cone and generate sound waves. These drives are made up of more than 95 graphene and retain most of the mechanical properties of the material, while being easier to form and cheaper to manufacture. It is a lightweight, rigid and low-density material, which is very suitable for loudspeaker diaphragm. The heavier the loudspeaker, the more difficult it is to drive. Because graphene has such a high strength-to-weight ratio, graphene drivers can reduce the power required to move coils back and forth, resulting in improved efficiency and better sound.OthersNatural graphite has been used in zinc-carbon batteries, motor brushes and various professional applications. Graphite with different hardness or softness will produce different qualities and tones when used as an artistic medium. The railway usually mixes graphite powder with waste oil or flaxseed oil to form a heat-resistant protective coating for exposed parts of steam locomotive boilers, such as smoke boxes or fire boxes.Graphite PriceThe price is influenced by many factors including the supply and demand in the market, industry trends, economic activity, market sentiment, and unexpected events.If you are looking for the latest graphite powder price, you can send us your inquiry for a quote. sales3nanotrun.comGraphite SupplierLuoyang Tongrun Nano Technology Co.

After Russia pledged to scale back its military operations around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine, the prices of most industrial metals fell, led by aluminum, showing people's concerns for supply shortage eased.
Besides, speaking by video at an international conference, Ukraine's minister of agricultural policy and Food, said the country's grain graphite powder are expected to continue to be influenced by international situations.
In a recent interview with Izvestia, Russian Federation Council Chairman Matviyenko said that Russia is open to dialogue with the West based on mutual respect, but the opportunity to resume dialogue will only come after the end of special military operations.
