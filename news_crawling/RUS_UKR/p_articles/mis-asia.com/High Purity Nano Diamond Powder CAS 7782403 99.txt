India, which imports about 84 of its crude oil needs, is reducing its import bill by increasing biofuel use, among other things.
The roble had hit a record low after the West imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine. Russia's president recently ordered exports of Russian gas to "unfriendly" countries to be settled in robles. The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Moscow was prepared and could shift supplies to markets such as Asia if Europe refused to buy Russian energy.
The Kremlin spokesman said, "According to the March 31 deadline set by Russia's president, we are developing all payment methods to get a simple, understandable, and feasible system for relevant European and international buyers,"
India is the world's third-largest importer and consumer of crude oil. Brazil currently supplies only a fraction of India's crude oil imports.

About Nano Diamond Powder:Diamond Nanopowder is the hardest known material. The industrial production of nano-scaled diamonds takes place at high temperatures and under high pressure.What is Nano Diamond Technology?The Nano Diamond Battery NDB is a high-power, diamond-based alpha, beta, and neutron voltaic battery that can provide lifelong and green energy for numerous applications and overcome the limitations of existing chemical batteries. The NDB acts like a tiny nuclear generator.Applications of diamond Nanoparticles include their use as filling components in synthetic materials and in the production of polishes. In oil for bicycle chains, they supposedly reduce friction. Diamond has been considered for use in several medical applications due to its unique mechanical, chemical, optical, and biological properties. In addition, recent developments involving the use of diamond in prostheses, sensing, imaging, and drug delivery applications.Why is diamond so hard?The outermost shell of each carbon atom has four electrons. Indiamond, these electrons are shared with four other carbon atoms to formverystrong chemical bonds resulting in anextremelyrigid tetrahedral crystal. It is this simple, tightly bonded arrangement that makesdiamondone of the hardest substances on Earth.Diamond Nanopowder is gray spherical high surface area carbon. Nanoscale Carbon Particles are typically 10  45 nanometers nm with specific surface area SSA in the 30  50 m 2 g range and also available in with an average particle size of 75  100 nm range with a specific surface area of approximately 2  10 m 2 g.Is diamond powder dangerous?Acute health effects: May cause eye irritation, severe eye damage, and skin irritation due to mechanical wear of diamond powders. The fine diamond powder may be inhaled and cause respiratory irritation.Nanodiamonds or diamond nanoparticles are diamonds with a size below 1 micrometer. They can be produced by impact events such as an explosion or meteoritic impacts. Because of their inexpensive, large-scale synthesis, the potential for surface functionalization, and high biocompatibility, nanodiamonds are widely investigated as potential material in biological and electronic applications and quantum engineering.TRUNNANO is a trusted global Nano DiamondPowdersupplier. Feel free to send an inquiry about the latestNano Diamondpriceat any time. How is Nano Diamond PowderProduced?Diamond nanopowders can be produced by multi-cathode DC plasma chemical vapor deposition and high-pressure high temperature HPHT. The potential use of nanodiamonds in biosensor applications. The surface modification of nanodiamonds can enhance its connection mechanism with specific biomolecules.How are nanodiamonds made?Currently, nanodiamonds are made by detonating an explosive in a reactor vessel to provide heat and pressure. The diamond particles must then be removed and purified from contaminating elements massed around them. The process is quick and cheap but the nanodiamonds aggregate and are of varying size and purity.Features of Nano Diamond Powder cas 7782-40-3nano Diamond powder purity: 99.5nano Diamond powder APS: 3-5 nmaccording to user's requirementsnano Diamond powder SSA: 286.4521 m2gnano Diamond powder decomposing Temperature: 629.98oCnano Diamond powder color: blacknano Diamond powder morphology: spherical  flakynano Diamond powder ash:2.218nano Diamond powder bulk density: 0.16 gcm3nano Diamond powder true density: 3.05-3.30 gcm3nano Diamond powder Making Method by Explosion Synthesized
