Russian forces have struck more than 400 educational establishments and 59 of them have been destroyed, Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said on Facebook.
The US State Department announced the sanctions on 11 Russian military leaders, including several deputy ministers of defense and Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and a member of Russian President Vladimir Putin's security council.
They were the latest sanctions imposed on Moscow since Russian forces invaded Ukraine nearly three weeks ago in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Moscow calls the assault a "special operation."
The sanctions freeze any US assets those targeted may have and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.

The Ukrainian prosecutor general said on Wednesday 103 children have been killed so far in the war in Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Russian military leaders and people it accused of being connected to human rights violations while slapping fresh measures on Moscow's close ally Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
