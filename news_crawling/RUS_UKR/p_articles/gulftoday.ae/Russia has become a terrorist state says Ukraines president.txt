In a virtual address to the UN Security Council, Zelensky urged the UN to establish an international tribunal to investigate "the actions of Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil and to hold the country accountable.
In urging Russias ouster from the 193-member United Nations, Zelensky cited Article 6 of the UN Charter which states that a member "which has persistently violated the principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.
"What is punished at the level of specific criminals and criminal organizations must not go unpunished at the level of a state that has become a terrorist, he said. "Daily terrorist acts. No days off. They work as terrorists every day.
Russias expulsion, however, is virtually impossible. Thats because as a permanent council member Russia would be able to use its veto to block any attempt to oust it.
Ukraine called the council meeting after Russias recent upsurge in attacks including Mondays fiery airstrike on a crowded shopping mall in the central city of Kremenchuk that Zelensky said killed at least 18 people and wounded 30 others. "Dozens are missing and body fragments have been found including hands and feet, he said, adding that unfortunately there may be more victims.
"We need to act urgently to do everything to make Russia stop the killing spree, Zelensky said, warning that otherwise Russias "terrorist activity will spread to other European countries and Asia, singling out the Baltic states, Poland, Moldova and Kazakhstan.
