Omnicom said in a statement: We have been planning an orderly process to ensure continuity of services for clients and to provide a future for our Russian colleagues some who have been with Omnicom for decades. We expect to finalise details shortly.
In addition, Interpublic, which has joint ventures with local partners and an affiliate relationship for media-buying,suspended its operations in Russia on 14 March.
Omnicom has become the latest agency holding group to withdraw from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.
The company said it is working with local partners to dispose of all of its investment positions in Russia.
The statement continued: We are in constant contact with our Ukrainian agency leaders and supporting our people with much needed humanitarian assistance, including transportation, accommodations, visa and working papers, translation services, relocation support, supplies and medical support.
The move follows hot on the heels of Dentsu International's decision to exit Russia 16 March and Publicis Groupe's announcement that itwas cutting ties with Russiaand handing over control of its agencies to local management 15 March.
The group added that it also has more than 200 colleagues in Ukraine and noted that, as the violence and humanitarian crisis continues, its number one priority is the safety and well-being of its Ukraine staff and their families.
The agency network is working with local partners to pull out of all of its investment positions in the country.
