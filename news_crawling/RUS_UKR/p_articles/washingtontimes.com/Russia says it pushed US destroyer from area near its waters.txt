The Russian warships maneuver during Fridays incident appeared to indicate Moscows readiness to raise the stakes to prevent similar intrusions in the future.
Russia, the U.S. and its NATO allies have frequently accused each other of dangerous and provocative maneuvers at sea and in the air as Russia-West ties have been hit by Moscows annexation of Crimea, accusations of Russian interference with elections, hacking attacks and other tensions.
MOSCOW AP  Russias Defense Ministry said a Russian warship on Friday prevented a U.S. Navy destroyer from what it described as an attempt to intrude into Russias territorial waters in the Sea of Japan.
In June, Russia said one of its warships fired warning shots and a warplane dropped bombs in the path of British destroyer Defender to drive it away from Black Sea waters near the Crimean city of Sevastopol. Britain denied that account, insisted its ship wasnt fired upon and said it was sailing in Ukrainian waters.
The incident came as Russia and China conducted joint naval drills in the area, and follows other dangerously close encounters involving Russian and Western warships. It appears to reflect Moscows intention to raise the stakes in deterring the U.S. and its allies from sending their ships on missions near Russian waters, as relations between Russia and the West are at a post Cold War low.
In other recent naval incidents, the Russian military said the British destroyer HMS Dragon intruded into Russian waters near Crimea in October 2020, and the U.S. destroyer USS John S. McCain allegedly violated the Russian border in the Peter the Great Gulf in the Sea of Japan in November.
In the aftermath of the incident, Moscow warned that it is prepared to target intruding warships if they fail to heed warnings. In a statement intended to signal Russian resolve, Russian President Vladimir Putin charged that the incident couldnt have triggered a global conflict even if Russia had sunk the warship because the West knows it cant win such a war.
It said the Russian vessel came close to the U.S. warship after it had ignored repeated warnings to leave the area in the Peter the Great Gulf. The ministry charged that after making an attempt to cross the Russian sea border, the U.S. warship changed course when the two ships were just 60 meters 66 yards away from each other and sped away.
The encounter revived memories of a Cold War incident when a Soviet frigate bumped the U.S. cruiser USS Yorktown in the Black Sea as it was making an innocent passage in Russian waters in 1988, damaging the U.S. warship.
Junes incident marked the first time since the Cold War that Moscow acknowledged using live ammunition to deter a NATO warship, underlining the rising threat of military collisions amid Russia-West tensions.
In the aftermath of those incidents, Russia rejected the U.S. and British arguments that their warships were exercising the right of so-called innocent passage under international maritime law.
It denounced the U.S. destroyers maneuvers as a crude violation of the international rules on averting ships collision and a 1972 agreement between Moscow and Washington on preventing air and naval incidents.
Like most of the world, Britain recognizes Crimea as part of Ukraine despite the peninsulas 2014 annexation by Russia.
The ministry said that the Russian navys Admiral Tributs destroyer closely approached the U.S. destroyer USS Chafee to chase it out of the area near Russian waters that was declared off-limits to shipping due to the gunnery drills there as part of the Russia-China maneuvers.
Retired Adm. Viktor Kravchenko, the former Russian navy chief of staff, said Fridays incident could have had grave consequences. The Americans apparently wanted to test our strength, he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
