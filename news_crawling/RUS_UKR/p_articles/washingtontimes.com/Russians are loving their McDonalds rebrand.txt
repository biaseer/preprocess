But that hasnt stopped some former franchisees from keeping the familiar golden arches on their wrappers or from selling the Big Mac under a different name.
The Daily Mail reported that Mr. Govor bought about 700 restaurants. Mr. Paroev said he wants to reach Mr. Govors goal of 1,000 stores in four to five years ahead of schedule.
While using the American companys branding is illegal under Russian law, Vkusno  Tochka owner Alexander Govor is still trying to sway some of the roughly 100 remaining former franchisees to join his new brand. Mr. Paroev said theyre mainly concentrated in train stations and airports.
McDonalds sold all of its restaurants to a Russia-based licensee in May in response to the countrys invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. Fifty locations of Vkusno  Tochka officially reopened in the Moscow area on June 12 and 13.
The rebrand also meant that Vkusno  Tochka lost the rights to McDonalds trademarks and intellectual properties, so customers were greeted with a new logo, packaging and color scheme when the store reopened.
The initial excitement will have to overcome some long-term challenges. Staples such as Big Macs and McFlurrys are no longer on the menu, and recipes for other products were required to change as well.
The Daily Mail in the U.K. reported that a record-breaking amount of burger sales were enjoyed by Vkusno  Tochka  or Tasty and thats it.
On the first day we sold almost 120,000 burgers, Chief Executive Oleg Paroev told the Daily Mail. We have never seen such daily turnover in the whole time McDonalds has worked in Russia.
