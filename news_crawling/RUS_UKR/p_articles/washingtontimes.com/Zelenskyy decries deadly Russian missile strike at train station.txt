Thats how Russia came to defend Donbas. Thats how Russia came to protect Russian-speaking people, Mr. Zelenskyy said in an address to Finlands parliament.
In recent days, Ukrainian officials said people were running out of time to evacuate the Donbas region.
NATO officials expect a protracted fight in Ukraine even though Russia has withdrawn from Kyiv and focused its attacks on eastern regions partially controlled by Russia-backed separatists.
The missile strike happened earlier in the morning in Kramatorsk, a city located in the disputed Donbas region.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday denounced Russia for a missile strike that hit a train station in eastern Ukraine, killing at least 39 people and wounding more than 300.
The U.K. Ministry of Defence on Friday said Russian forces have fully withdrawn from northern Ukraine to Belarus and Russia, and at least some of these forces will be transferred to east Ukraine to fight in the Donbas.
Local officials said thousands of people were at the station, trying to evacuate the region when the attack occurred.
The Russians knew where they were hitting and who they were targeting, Ukrainian officials said on the Telegram social messaging page. They wanted to destroy everything Ukrainian.
Russia has reportedly denied firing the missile. A Kremlin spokesperson told the BBC that Russia had no missions in the area where the train station was hit.
There are witnesses. There are videos, he said. There are remnants of missiles but there are no more people.
