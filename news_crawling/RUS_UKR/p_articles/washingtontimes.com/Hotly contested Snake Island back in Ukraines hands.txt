The Russian Federation does not interfere with the efforts of the United Nations to organize a humanitarian corridor for the export of agricultural products from the territory of Ukraine, Russian military officials said in a statement posted on the Telegram social networking application.
Russian forces on Thursday left Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost made famous in the early stages of Moscows invasion of Ukraine when defenders tersely and profanely rejected an attacking warships demand to surrender. The incident became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance in the face of what at the time seemed overwhelming odds.
Kyiv and the West have accused Moscow of causing a global food crisis by blocking Ukrainian agricultural exports from leaving Black Sea ports. Its an accusation that Moscow denies.
The reason for the overnight evacuation depends on which side is talking. Kyiv says they drove off the Russians in a military attack, forcing the occupiers to flee in a pair of speedboats. The Russian Defense Ministry said the Russian mission there had been accomplished.
While photographs of smoke rising from the rocky island lend credence to Ukraines claims, Russian defense officials said they left the island as a gesture of goodwill, stating their forces withdrew after they completed their tasks.
They couldnt stand the weather  the ground was burning under their feet, the sea was boiling, the air was too hot, Ukrainian military officials said early Thursday in a cheeky Twitter message.
