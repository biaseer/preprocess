The only ones who can stop the counter attacks on Russia are the Russians. They must depose and punish Putin and his allies quickly.
Because things are not going as expected, Putin has put his nuclear forces on high alert. Putin is greedy and crazy. He wants to take Ukraine for its natural resources so he and his greedy friends can fill their bank accounts with money. He does not care about Ukrainian lives, Russian lives or anyone but himself and his greedy allies.
Many Russians are protesting the war even though it means going to jail. The Russian people must rise up and put an end to Putin in order to put an end to this war. If they do not, eventually the Ukrainians will decide to expand the battlefields into Russia so that Russians get a taste of the misery and pain of Putins war against Ukraine. The Ukrainians will target roads, railroads, power lines, oil and gas lines, military bases, airports and the Kremlin. And because civilian areas of Ukraine have been targeted by Russia, Ukrainians will attack Moscow, St. Petersburg, Volgograd and other cities.
Vladimir Putins war on Ukraine is proving much more deadly for Russia than its 10-year war in Afghanistan. While fighting in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union lost over 50,000 soldiers. The Ukrainian representative to the United Nations revealed that approximately 5,000 Russian soldiers had died in the first five days of the attack on Ukraine.
