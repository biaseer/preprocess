Speaking of the Russian invasion, the president stressed the need to create humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of people from Ukrainian cities surrounded and shelled by Russian troops.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that the EU must urgently diversify its sources of energy imports and get rid of its energy dependence on Russia.
VILNIUS  Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Tiesday attend a preparatory European Council session and called for expanding the existing sanctions for Russia, especially in the energy sector.
The virtual EC meeting was attended by European Council President Charles Michel, as well as representatives of Finland, Greece, the Czech Republic and Croatia.
The upcoming EC session should discuss both the provision of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and practical steps towards rapprochement with the EU, Nauseda said.
The growing number of war refugees in Europe also made it necessary to provide assistance mechanisms for countries hosting war refugees, Nauseda added.
"Russia is funding its bloody action in Ukraine with the money we pay them for oil and gas. This cannot continue. We cannot fund terrorism with our own money," the Lithuanian president said. "The new sanctions package must include tough sanctions on Russia's energy sector."
