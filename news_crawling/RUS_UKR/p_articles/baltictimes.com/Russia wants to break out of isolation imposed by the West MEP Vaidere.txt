"It is clear that NATO must not give in to the absurd demands of Russian President Vladimir Putin," Vaidere said, adding that the Alliance's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg rightly said on Wednesday that there was no question of reducing NATO's presence in Eastern Europe and that Russia could not decide which countries can or cannot join the Alliance.
"It is clear that Russia wants to get out of the isolation imposed by the West, in which it has deservedly driven itself in, especially after the annexation of Crimea," the politician writes.
RIGA - Russia wants to get out of the isolation imposed by the West that it has set for itself, European Parliament Member Inese Vaidere New Unity said on Twitter on Wednesday.
According to her, Russia's recent "security concerns" are deeply confusing, and not even many Russians really understand them.
She believes that Russia's aggressive foreign policy is like childish hooliganism in a desperate attempt to draw attention to itself.
