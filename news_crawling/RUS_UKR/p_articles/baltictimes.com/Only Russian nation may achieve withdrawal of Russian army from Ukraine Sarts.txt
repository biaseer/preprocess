He said in an interview with the Latvian public television that Russia has come to a deadlock after its attack on Ukraine.
RIGA - In the current situation, only the Russian nation may achieve rapid withdrawal of the Russian army from Ukraine, said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence in Riga.
Asked about the possible withdrawal tactics if Putin understands that he has lost, Sarts said that this could be achieved only by the Russian nation. "I do not see any other scenarios how Putin could withdraw from the situation, keep the face and the position," he said.
"It was clear from the very beginning, that if Ukraine succeeds, Russia at one point will start to rattle its nuclear arms. And as we see it - Ukraine has been succeeding. They Ukrainians have not only surprised the world, but also Russian President Vladimir Putin," said Sarts.
The expert said that the Russian authorities are very concerned about the mood in Russia as it is hard for them to justify the attack on Ukrainians, therefore Russia is trying to block access to objective information about the situation in Ukraine.
"Of course, tension in the society is growing. The protests are being suppressed, but at one moment there might be an explosion," he said.
