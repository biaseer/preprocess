RIGA - Both Ukraine and Russia are ready to prolong the hostilities in Ukraine, the Latvian Institute of International Affairs researcher Martins Vargulis told TV3 on Monday.
He believes that the war is now in the early or middle stages. "It just looks like both sides are ready to and want to prolong this until they achieve their goals," said Vargulis, emphasizing that this was particularly characteristic of Russia.
As reported, Russia launched a massive military offense against Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Western countries have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
There is currently no reason to believe that the end of the war is near. "I would say that 2022 will most likely be remembered for Russia's invasion of Ukraine," added Vargulis.
A three-day war that Russia most likely was hoping for has been going on for six months now. "We have seen several wave-like announcements and events, from both the Russian side and the Ukrainian side," said Vargulis.
