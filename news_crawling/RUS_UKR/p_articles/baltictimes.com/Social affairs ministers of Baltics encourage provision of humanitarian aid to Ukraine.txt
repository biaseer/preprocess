TALLINN - The social affairs ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania issued a joint statement in which they strongly condemn Russia's massive invasion of democratic Ukraine and encourage the provision of humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
"We invite to encourage civil society together with international NGOs to strengthen humanitarian aid for Ukrainian people. All international NGOs -- such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, Order of Malta Relief Organization, Caritas, Save the Children International, The Global FoodBanking Network -- are our committed partners who can provide assistance for people in need in Ukraine. Lets encourage our people to support these organizations and Ukrainian people," it is said in the statement.
"In these dark hours, we stand united with Ukraine and its people and encourage all the European Union ministers responsible for social affairs to join our efforts to ensure the humanitarian support to the Ukrainian people. We underline that the Baltic states are doing all in their power to activate needed human and financial resources to be ready to accept the Ukrainian citizens and to provide them with the necessary assistance, including food, accommodation and psychological support," the social affairs ministers said.
