The Prime Minister emphasized that the world has changed fundamentally since February 24, as Putin's Russia and the Russian armed forces involuntarily invaded a sovereign, independent and democratic Ukraine.
RIGA - The brutal footage of attacks on Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops will be the evidence needed against Russian President Vladimir Putin and others to be held accountable for the brutal war in Ukraine at the Hague Tribunal and elsewhere, Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins New Unity said in his annual address to the Saeima today.
Unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, Russian troops began targeting civilians in an attempt to destroy cities that are besieged or partially besieged. These are the types of unequivocal war crimes that are to be condemned in the strongest terms, the head of government said.
Karins emphasized that there are no gray shades in this situation, because "here is black and white", and it is clear that Putin's Russia is 100 percent to blame for the start of the war with Ukraine.
The Prime Minister emphasized the support provided by Latvia to Ukraine in various fields, including the provision of military support and the sending of Stinger air defense systems to Ukraine. ''We will also continue to provide humanitarian and other assistance to Ukraine,'' Karins noted.
The head of government thanked the people of Latvia, noting that the whole society had mobilized to support Ukraine. Karins also thanked the Saeima for its position in support of Ukraine, in which both the coalition and the opposition have a common opinion on these fundamental issues.
The prime minister's address lasted for about 50 minutes, touching on several issues, including those concerning Latvia's domestic policy.
