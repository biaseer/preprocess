"Lithuania initiated the so-called Hague process back in late February, requesting an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russia and Belarus under the Rome Statute," Simonyte said at a joint press conference with her Latvian and Estonian counterparts in Riga.
VILNIUS  More than 40 countries around the world have joined Lithuania's call to investigate Russia's war crimes in Ukraine, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said on Friday.
"More than 40 countries from all over the world have now joined this call," she added.
Lithuania was the first country to ask the International Criminal Court's prosecutor to open an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russia and Belarus.
The prime minister also said it is important "to keep international efforts focused on ensuring that those responsible for war crimes do not escape accountability".
