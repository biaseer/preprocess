In a statement, Eleazar said the decision only reinforces the moral values of the Filipino people as a peace-loving nation.
At present, the Philippine government is exerting all efforts to ensure that Filipinos in Ukraine are in safe condition.
Eleazar also called on the government to start crafting measures to cushion the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the economy, especially that analysts have been quoted saying that fuel price will continue to increase as a result of the armed conflict.
Eleazar said the Philippines itself has a long history of armed conflict that told harrowing stories of deaths, including the stories personeally told to him by his father who was a World War II veteran.
Eleazar, who is running for senator in the May 9 elections, said that while the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine has no direct impact on the country, it is necessary for the Philippines to voice out its position on the issue, especially on matters that concern world peace.
I welcome this development as this will strengthen the call to end atrocities and attacks in Ukraine and protect civilians in the area. This move by the Philippine government does not only reinforce our commitment to world peace but also the moral values of our people as a nation, said Eleazar.
The Philippines delegation appeals for the protection of civilians and an end to hostilities in Ukraine caused by the Russian invasion. It stressed that while an offense can be stopped at will, the defense cannot rest until the offense stops.
Former national police chief Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar lauded on Tuesday, Mar. 1, the decision of the Philippine government to vote in favor of the United Nations UN resolution condeming the invasion launched by Russia against Ukraine.
