He said refugees would be processed outside of the current border regime that bars foreign tourists and limits overseas arrivals.
Japan typically accepts just a few dozen refugees a year out of thousands of applicants, and its borders are currently closed to virtually all foreign visitors to prevent Covid-19 infections.
In 2020, Japan accepted just 47 refugees and 44 people on humanitarian grounds out of nearly 4,000 applicants, and rights groups have long accused Tokyo of doing too little to help those fleeing conflict.
Kishida said Japan expected to first accept those with relatives or friends in the country, but beyond that, we will respond from a humanitarian perspective, he added without setting a specific cap on arrivals.
Kishida said he had informed countries neighbouring Ukraine that are currently receiving refugees of the decision.
But Kishida said the country would now proceed with a plan to welcome people from Ukraine who have fled to third countries in a bid to demonstrate our solidarity with the Ukrainian people at such a crucial moment.
Kishidas remarks came after he held talks with the prime minister of Poland, which is hosting many of the more than 800,000 refugees who have fled Ukraine since the invasion began.
TOKYO, Japan Japan will accept Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russias ongoing invasion, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Wednesday, in a break with the countrys usual reticence to accept humanitarian arrivals.
