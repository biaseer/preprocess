Panelo said Ukraines valiant stand to defend itself against Russian aggression is admirable and inspiring to countries like ours that have disputes with larger nations that may lead to war.
For Panelo, it does not matter whether the United States US of America can be relied upon to honor the Mutual Defense Treaty MDT in the event of armed aggression from China, as the battles would be fought on Philippine soil.
Panelo said the next president should continue enforcing his former boss, Dutertes foreign policy as well as exert efforts to strengthen the countrys military.
Panelo said that whats happening in Ukraine and Russia is a stark reminder how the Philippines own maritime dispute with China could go easily awry. As such, he commended Dutertes prudence and resolve in terms of handling the countrys own conflict.
Our President was simply unwilling to put Filipinos in harms way, despite being consistently maligned and unfairly labeled as a China puppet by those not responsible for the protection of Filipino lives, he said.
Further, the Ukraine experience has shown that US involvement or the risk thereof may in fact serve as the very impetus for a preemptive attack from a threatened superpower, he said.
Former chief presidential legal adviser, senatorial aspirant Salvador Panelo on Tuesday, March 1 highlighted the importance of President Dutertes Filipino-first foreign policy, which he said placed Filipinos out of harms way in relation with the countrys territorial dispute with China.
