The Holy Father requests that all priests participate and concelebrate with the bishop. We will be joined by the ambassadors of the different nations and some government officials, said Arada.
Parishes in the Archdiocese of Manila were urged to join Pope Francis in the consecration of Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on March 25 by organizing a Mass.
Let us encourage our parishioners to join us in offering our prayers and sacrifices as an act of solidarity to our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, he added.
Arada said Pope Francis has expressed his desire that all local Churches join him in the Consecration of Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
In a circular letter, Fr. Carmelo Arada, the vice chancellor of the archdiocese, said parishes are encouraged to organize a Eucharistic Celebration or a Celebration of the Word wherein the Consecration to the Immaculate Heart will be prayed preferably at the same time or as close as possible to the time when the Holy Father will make the act of consecration which will be at around 12 midnight Philippine time March 25, 5 p.m. Rome time.
On the said day, he said, they will also gather at 6 p.m. at the Manila Cathedral as a presbyterium with the religious and the lay people.
We leave it to the discretion of the Parish Priests to decide on the details of the celebration in their communities. A circular will be issued as soon as the prayer is available, he said.
