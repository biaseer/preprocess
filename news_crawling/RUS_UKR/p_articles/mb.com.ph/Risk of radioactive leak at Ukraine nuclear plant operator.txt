The Zaporizhzhia facility was seized by Russian troops in the opening weeks of the February invasion and has remained on the front line ever since.
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA is urging for a mission to the plant as soon as possible to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there.
On Thursday, the plant was cut off from Ukraines national power grid for the first time in its four-decade history due to actions of the invaders, Energoatom said.
Kyiv and Moscow have traded accusations over shelling in the vicinity of the complex, located in the city of Energodar.
As a result of periodic shelling, the infrastructure of the station has been damaged, there are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high, Energoatom said on Telegram.
Russias defence ministry said Ukrainian forces shelled the territory of the station three times in the past day.
The agency said that as of midday Saturday 0900 GMT the plant operates with the risk of violating radiation and fire safety standards.
It came back online on Friday afternoon but Zelensky warned the worst case scenario  is constantly being provoked by Russian forces.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the power cut was caused by Russian shelling of the last active power line linking the plant to the network.
Energoatom said Moscows troops had repeatedly shelled the site of the plant in southern Ukraine over the past day, whilst Russia defence ministry claimed Kyivs troops were responsible.
