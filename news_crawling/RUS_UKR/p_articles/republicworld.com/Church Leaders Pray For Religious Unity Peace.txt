The Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine spent a silent protest against Ecumenical Patriarch's visit to Ukraine.
Speaking at the service, Epiphanius I lamented that "not all orthodoxies of Ukraine did not realise the truth" of unity of religious beliefs.
Metropolitan Epiphanius I is head of the Ukrainian Orthodox church at St Sophia's Cathedral, independent of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I, shared a service on Sunday with Ukrainian Metropolitan in Kyiv in a demonstration of "unity in belief."
