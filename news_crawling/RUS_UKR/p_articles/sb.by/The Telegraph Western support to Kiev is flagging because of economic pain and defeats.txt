According to the columnist, the unwillingness to provide financial assistance is confirmed by the fact that, last week, the European Commission blocked a loan of 1.5bn Euros for Ukraine.
For Kiev to continue hostilities, it needs even greater economic assistance from external forces. Mr. Kemp considers Western leaders may start putting pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to start negotiations with Russia.
According to the publication, the United States was earlier ready to face the consequences of restrictive measures against Russia and to transfer generous sums to the Kiev government if it successfully completed tasks in the process of confrontation with the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, at present  when $54bn has been injected into the conflict  Ukraine is losing, the journalist stressed.
The collective West is rendering less help to Kiev now, since it experiences a negative effect of its anti-Russian sanctions and due to the defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Donbass  as noted by The Telegraph columnist Richard Kemp, RIA Novosti reports
Mr. Kemp believes the support will weaken with the conflict escalation. The approach of winter and an even greater increase in demand for oil and gas will also contribute to the trend. The European heads will step on each other to restore economic relations with Moscow and revive a flow of Russian energy resources, the columnist said.
