Earlier, the Adviser to Ukraines Interior Minister, Viktor Andrusiv, said Scholz, Draghi and Macron intended to propose Volodymyr Zelenskyy to return to peace talks with the Russian side. In turn, the press secretary of Russias President, Dmitry Peskov, noted that the negotiation process has come to a standstill, and its continuation is unlikely.
"European connoisseurs of frogs, liver and pasta like to visit Kiev  with a zero benefit. They have again promised the EU membership and old howitzers, they have drunk vodka and went home  by train, as it was common a century ago. All is good. But this is not brining Ukraine closer to peace  though clock is ticking, he tweeted.
Mr. Medvedev noted that the visit of the leaders of Germany, Italy and France will not contribute to improving the situation in Ukraine in any way.
