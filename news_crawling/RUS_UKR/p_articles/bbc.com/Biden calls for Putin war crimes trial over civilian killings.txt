In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light.
Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed.
In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs.
"We heard them being shot," said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. "We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."
