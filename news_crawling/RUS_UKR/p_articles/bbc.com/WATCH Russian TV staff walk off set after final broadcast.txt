One of Russias last independent news outlets TV Rain has stopped broadcasting indefinitely after coming under pressure for its coverage of Ukraine.
Russia's telecommunications regulator accused the channel of "inciting extremism, abusing Russian citizens, causing mass disruption of public calm and safety, and encouraging protests".
The channel, also know as Dozhd, ended its final broadcast by showing staff walking off set on Thursday.
