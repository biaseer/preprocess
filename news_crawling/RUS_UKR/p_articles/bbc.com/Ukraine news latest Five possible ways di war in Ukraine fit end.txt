Di key question na weda di West fit offer wetin diplomats dey refer to as "off ramp", American term for an exit from major highway.
E no go return to di status quo ante or how e bin dey before.
But what if dat outcome na im losing power? E fit be like say e dey unthinkable.
President Putin go declare victory and witdraw some forces, den leave enough behind to maintain some control.
If im dey, perhaps, face defeat for Ukraine, im fit dey tempted to escalate further.
Di West den make am clear say if Putin go and dem replace am wit more moderate leader, den Russia go see di lifting of some sanctions and restoration of normal diplomatic relations.
Dis kain result go dey unstable and di possibility  of conflict happuning again go dey high.
But Oga Putin fit take di risk if im fell say na di only way of saving im leadership.
Under Article 5 of di military alliance charter, attack on one member na attack on all.
He fit threaten to send troops go di Baltic states - wey be members of Nato - like Lithuania, to establish land corridor wit Russia coastal exclave of Kaliningrad.
Dis fit no dey likely. But e no dey beyond possibility say dis option fit come up from di destructions dis bloody conflict.
Dis different possible ways out fit no just happun exactly as we paint here - some of each fit combine to produce different outcomes.
Dem go either assassinate President Zelensky or e go run comot from di kontri, to western Ukraine or even overseas, to set up goment for exile.
Dis outcome no dey impossible but e go depend on if several factors change: Russian forces perform better, Russia send in more forces, and Ukraine extraordinary fighting spirit fade.
Maybe e go take longer for Russian forces to takeover cities like Kyiv wey im defenders dey fight from street to street. Dem fit surround am for long.
Few fit predict di future wit confidence, but dis na some possible outcomes. Most no dey clear.
And den, maybe afta many years, wit maybe new leadership for Moscow, Russian forces go eventually leave Ukraine, bowed and bloodied, just as di pipo before dem leave Afghanistan for 1989 afta 10 years of  decade fighting Islamist insurgents.
Oga Putin fit declare Western arms supplies to Ukrainian forces na act of aggression wey warrant retaliation.
China intervene, putting pressure on Moscow to compromise, warning say e no go buy Russia oil and gas unless e de-escalate.
President Putin fit want to regain more parts of Russia former empire by sending troops into former Soviet republics like Moldova and Georgia, wey no be part of Nato.
And, surprisingly, Russia and Ukraine officials don meet for tok-tok for di border wit Belarus.
Di news from di battlefield, di diplomatic noise off, di emotion of di grieving and displaced all of dis fit dey overwhelming.
Di Russian air force - wey dia action dey low-key role so far - go launch devastating airstrikes.
Most analysts doubt say dis mean e dey likely to use am or soon too.
Inside dis tick cloud of war, e fit dey hard to see di way forward.
So make we step back small and consider how di conflict for Ukraine fit play out.
And even once Russian forces don achieve some presence for Ukraine cities, maybe dia struggle to maintain control.
Maybe Russian forces go slow down, sake of low morale, poor logistics and yeye leadership.
Wetin be some of di possible ways wey politicians and military planners fit dey consider?
"Di guns dey talk now, but di channel for tok-tok must always remain open," according to UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres.
In turn, Putin accept Ukrainian independence and im right to get deeper ties wit Europe.
But e fit no dey possible if pipo wey don benefit from Putin no longer believe say im fit defend dia interests.
And what of Vladimir Putin imsef? Wen im launch im invasion, im declare: "We ready for any outcome."
Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies for Kings College, London, write dis week: "Now e dey likely say dem go get regime change for Moscow like for Kyiv."
And di liberal, international rules-based order just fit rediscovered wetin e dey dia for in di first place.
Yet di world don change in recent days and e possible to tin of dis kain tins.
But na reminder say Russian doctrine allow for di possible use of tactical nuclear weapons for battlefield.
Dem fit no make much progress. But, by agreeing to tok, e e like Putin don at least agree to di possibility of negotiating ceasefire.
Di fighting dey remind pesin of Russia long and brutal struggle for di 1990s to seize and mostly destroy Grozny, di capital of Chechnya.
Diplomats say e dey important di Russia leader know wetin e go take for di West to lift dia sanctions so day face-saving deal fit at least dey possible.
Mr Putin fit achieve regime change for Kyiv and di end of Ukraine mixing wit di west.
Meanwhile, Ukraine authorities see di continuous destruction of dia kontri and conclude say political compromise fit beta pass dat kain destruction and loss of life.
Im judge say continuing di war fit be greater threat to im leadership dan di humiliation of ending am.
But dis turn sour and enough members of Russia military, political and economic elite turn against am.
