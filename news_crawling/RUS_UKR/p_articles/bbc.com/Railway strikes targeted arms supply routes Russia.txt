Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border.
Global military spending exceeded $2tn 1.6tn for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says.
It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said.

The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine.
