Russia's President Putin has sought to justify Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by saying his country is now trying to regain its "original territories", just as Russia's ruler Peter the Great did at the beginning of the 18th century.
Noting that he was talking about the area on which the city of St Petersburg was founded, Putin added that none of the European countries at the time recognised this as Russian territory.
"Peter the Great waged the Northern War for 21 years, and it would seem that he fought with Sweden and tore away something from it. But he didn't carve out anything! He was regaining territory," Putin told a meeting of young entrepreneurs in Moscow on Thursday, in remarks shown live on Rossiya 24 rolling news channel.
"And if we proceed from the premise that these basic values are the foundation of our existence we will certainly succeed in solving the tasks we are facing," he said in an apparent reference to Moscow's current invasion of Ukraine.
"Everyone recognised it as Sweden, and Slavs lived there from time immemorial along with the Finno-Ugric peoples. Moreover, this territory was under the control of the Russian state," Putin said.
