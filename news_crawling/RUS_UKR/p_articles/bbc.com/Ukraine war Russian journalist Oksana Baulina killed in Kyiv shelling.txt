Investigative journalist Viktor Dudar was killed on the front line during a battle with Russian troops near the southern city of Mykolaiv, Ukrainian reports said.
Baulina had previously sent several reports from Kyiv and the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, The Insider said.
Two Fox News journalists - cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24 - also lost their lives when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire on the outskirts of Kyiv.
Then in early March Yevhenii Sakun, a camera operator for Ukrainian TV channel LIVE who also worked for the Spanish news agency EFE, died during shelling of the TV transmission tower in Kyiv.
Last year the foundation was made illegal and branded extremist by the authorities, forcing many of its staff to flee abroad.
Two weeks later, US journalist and filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was shot dead as he was filming in the town of Irpin outside Kyiv.
Baulina previously worked for Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption foundation, and had left Russia.
