On the other hand, the Palestinian Authority, which is pressing for an international peace conference sponsored by the Quartet, needs the support of Russia, a member of the Quartet.
The PA Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet commented on the events, but Fatah spokesman Jamal Nazal is trying to take advantage of the events and justify security coordination with Israel, which is criticized within the PA.
The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have maintained silence and prefer not to comment on the war in Ukraine due to the fear that taking a stand with one of the sides will harm their interests.
For his part, PA head Mahmoud Abbas fears a confrontation with the Biden administration while the PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh pressures members of Congress to open the consulate in Jerusalem and the PLO is waiting to open its offices in Washington.
Negotiations and security coordination are now underway between Russia and Ukraine over the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, although the parties are at war, Nazal wrote. Therefore, there is no logic in the claim that Fatah withdrew from the struggle against Israel after Oslo and the second intifada.
