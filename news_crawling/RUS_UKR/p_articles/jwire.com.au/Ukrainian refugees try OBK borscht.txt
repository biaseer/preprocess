The afternoon began with cooking followed by a meal and an original video presentation by cameraman Roman Polura and a concert by Maryana Sywak, Ilya Bayer, Anatoli Torjinski and Leo Novikov.
Anna Maylis, who runs the Kangarusski organisation, said: The families all made up exclusively of women as men are prohibited to leave the war-torn country.
Sydneys Our Big Kitchen and Kangarusski ZFA have hosted eight Ukrainian families who arrived in Australia over the past few weeks having escaped the war.
Over 100 participants Australians originally from Russia and Ukraine came together at the Bondi commercial kitchen to cook over 650 meals, inducing a big pot of borscht for the new arrivals.
Rabbi Dr Dovid Slavin Founding Director of OBK said: This is a very powerful statement that despite the raging war in Europe Australians from both warring sides can and must come together in respect and harmony.
Every aspect of this day is significant, a demonstration of harmony, a warm welcome, a time to relax and enjoy, and meals to support the arrivals for the coming weeks.
