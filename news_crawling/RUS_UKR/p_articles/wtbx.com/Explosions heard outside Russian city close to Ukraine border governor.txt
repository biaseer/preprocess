Reuters      A series of explosions were heard on Tuesday night outside the Russian city of Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine, the local governor said, adding there were no casualties.
Video posted online from two local Belgorod news outlets appeared to show ammunition blowing up in the distance but Reuters was not immediately able to confirm this was the case.
Vyacheslav Gladkov said in an online post that the blasts occurred near the village of Krasny Oktyabr, about 30 km 19 miles southwest of Belgorod. He did not give a reason for the blasts and promised an update later.
Belgorod is 80 km 50 miles north of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, which Russian forces have bombarded heavily in recent weeks.
