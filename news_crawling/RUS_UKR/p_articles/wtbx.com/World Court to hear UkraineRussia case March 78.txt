The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, is the United Nations venue for resolving disputes between states.
Ukraines lawsuit filed on Sunday argues that Russias claim it invaded Ukraine to prevent a genocide is false.
Ukraines case argues that the countries have a dispute over a treaty known as the Genocide Convention, which both have signed. Ukraine argues that no genocide took place in Donbass, and that the treaty in any case does not give one country the right to invade another to prevent a genocide.
While the ICJ is the United Nations highest court and its rulings are binding, states including Russia have ignored them in the past.
Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that he had filed the lawsuit at the court over genocide accusations made by Moscow.
Russian President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly asserted that Ukraine committed genocide in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, without presenting evidence, and said the invasion, called a special operation by Russian officials, was therefore justified to end it.
The U.N. court said in a statement it had sent Russia an urgent communication to prepare in case it does order provisional measures, or immediate steps, to protect Ukraine, as it has requested.
AMSTERDAM Reuters -The World Court on Tuesday said it will hold hearings on March 7-8 on whether to order provisional measures in a lawsuit brought by Ukraine against Russia seeking a halt to Moscows military actions in Ukraine.
At the March 7-8 hearings, judges will not consider questions of jurisdiction or of the merits of Ukraines case, but only whether the matter is so urgent they must order some immediate measure in the interests of justice before the case can be heard in full.
