"It shall be prohibited for any aircraft operated by Russian air carriers, including as a marketing carrier in code-sharing or blocked-space arrangements, or for any Russian registered aircraft, or for any non-Russian-registered aircraft which is owned or chartered, or otherwise controlled by any Russian natural or legal person, entity or body, to land in, take off from or overfly the territory of the union," the document reads.
The European Union has closed its airspace to Russia due to the situation in Ukraine, according to a document published in the Official Journal of the European Union on Monday, TASS reports.
However, "the competent authorities may authorize an aircraft to land in, take off from, or overfly, the territory of the union if the competent authorities have determined that such landing, take-off or overflight is required for humanitarian purposes or for any other purpose consistent with the objectives of this regulation."
