According to Putin, Russia's plans do not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories, and Russia's actions are not about harming Ukraine's interests, but about protecting itself from those who have taken Ukraine hostage.
The Russian president also said that the decision for an operation in Ukraine was taken in response to a request from the leaders of the two republics in Donbas separatist Donetsk and Luhansk. The purpose of the operation said the Russian leader, is "to protect the people who for eight years have been subjected to torture, genocide by the Kyiv regime, and therefore we will seek the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, as well as bringing to justice those who have committed numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including citizens of the Russian Federation."
