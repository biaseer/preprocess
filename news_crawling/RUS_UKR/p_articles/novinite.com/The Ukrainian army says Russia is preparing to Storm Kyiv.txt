A bulletin published earlier this morning said the Russian military aimed to take full control of the cities of Irpin and Bucha, northwest of the Ukrainian capital. Russia's armed forces are also trying to gain a tactical advantage by reaching the eastern outskirts of Kyiv through the Brovary and Borispol districts, the Ukrainian General Staff said.
Quite a large amount of Russian military equipment and soldiers are concentrated on the approaches to Kyiv, Vadim Denisenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, said on television. We understand that the battle for Kyiv is a key battle which will be fought in the coming days, he added.  BTA
