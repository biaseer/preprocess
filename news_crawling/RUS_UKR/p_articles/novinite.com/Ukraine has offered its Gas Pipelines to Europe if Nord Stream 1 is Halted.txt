Ukrainian gas transmission network GTSOU has proposed that the gas that Germany and other European countries have paid for and expect on Nord Stream 1 would then pass through its pipes and through Poland, which has also agreed to take over the transport.
"Gazprom" announced that it will stop the gas on this pipeline again for a technical inspection from August 31 to September 2.

"Our capacities and the route through Poland are more than sufficient for the transfer of gas to Europe so that Russia can meet its obligations," GTSOU said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately sabotaging gas transfers to blackmail the West.
Ukraine has offered to provide its gas transmission network for the delivery of Russian gas to Europe after Nord Stream 1 has been failing so much lately and constantly having to shut down the gas on it.
In July, Nord Stream 1 underwent a technical inspection for 20 days and again had no gas on it.
"Gazprom" reduced its supplies to Germany and supplied only 20 of the agreed and paid quantity.
