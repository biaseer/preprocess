Many of those fleeing the Russian offensive in the south of Ukraine are heading to Moldova, one of Europes poorest states, which is now preparing to welcome a second wave of refugees.
The UN refugee agency says more than 2.5 million people have left Ukraine since the start of the war.
The continuing exodus is beginning to place a strain on governments and volunteer networks in neighbouring countries.
