Russia and Ukraine have agreed two deals that will reopen Black Sea ports used to export millions of tonnes of trapped Ukrainian grain.
The agreement was brokered by the UN and Turkey and will ease fears of worldwide grain shortages that have pushed up global food prices.
Moscow had accused Ukraine of failing to remove sea mines at the ports and has also insisted that incoming ships are not used to bring in weapons.
