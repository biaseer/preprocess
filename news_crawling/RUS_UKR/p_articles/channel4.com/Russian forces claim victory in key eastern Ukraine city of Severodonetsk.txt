Russian backed forces say they have seized control of a strategic city in eastern Ukraine, amid intense battles around key areas of Donbas.
Officials in Severodonetsk said 90 per cent of buildings there have been damaged under constant Russian bombardment, claiming the city was being systematically destroyed.
Ukraine is putting up stiff resistance, but say they urgently need more sophisticated weapons from the West to stop Russias advance.
