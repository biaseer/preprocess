The ship, which like many had been stuck in port since February, was finally able to set out after a deal struck last month guaranteeing safe passage.
The Razoni left Odesa this morning. Tomorrow it is due to reach Istanbul, where as part of the deal it will undergo checks by Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN officials, before travelling on to its final destination, the Lebanese port of Tripoli.
A ship loaded with Ukrainian grain has left the Black Sea port of Odesa for the first time since the Russian invasion.
