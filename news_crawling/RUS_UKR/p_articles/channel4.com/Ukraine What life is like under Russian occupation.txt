As Russian forces pound towns and cities in the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine with artillery, today a commander said Russia intended not only to take the east but also the entire south  potentially giving a route out to Transnistria, a pro-Russian enclave in Moldova.
Russia has already taken a large swathe of land in the south of Ukraine, including Manhush, Tokmak and Dniprorudne which have been living under occupation for most of the war.
Information from these places is scarce but we have spoken to some who have fled.
