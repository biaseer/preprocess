When a history is written of the first two months of Russias invasion of Ukraine, the massacre of people waiting to flee at Kramatorsk station will no doubt feature.
And, like the shelling of the theatre in Mariupol in March, it is following a similar script.
Then denial by the Russians that the event happened, followed by the suggestion that Ukranians had bombed themselves.
Locals had been warned to leave and thousands were trying to do so at the railway station when it was hit.
