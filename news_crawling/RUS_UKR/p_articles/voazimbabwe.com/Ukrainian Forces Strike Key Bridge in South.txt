Stremousov said Ukrainian forces used the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System HIMARS to carry out the strike.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted the bridge strikes in a tweet Wednesday, saying Russian forces should take them as a warning.
Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russia-appointed administration for the Kherson region, said the bridge was still standing after the late Tuesday strike, but that the road deck was full of holes.
Ukrainian forces have struck a strategically important bridge in the southern part of the country, using what a Russia-appointed official said were rocket systems supplied by the United States.
Podolyak said the Russians should learn how to swim across the river or leave Kherson while it is still possible.
The bridge is a key link allowing Russia to supply its forces in southern Ukraine.
