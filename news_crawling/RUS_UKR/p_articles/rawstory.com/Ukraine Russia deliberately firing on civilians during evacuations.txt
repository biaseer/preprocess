Ukraine has again accused Russia of human rights violations with regard to the situation in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.
"Because Russian terrorists do not keep all agreements, they do not feel sorrow even to kids, women or wounded people. Instead, they shelled accommodation houses and peaceful civilians during the evacuation," Resnikov wrote.
The Ukrainian government was doing everything possible to allow humanitarian corridors for evacuation, Defence Minister Oleksii Resnikov wrote on Facebook on Monday, adding that Russian troops were trying to "strangle" the city with a humanitarian crisis.
Strategically important Mariupol on the Sea of Azov is one of the most contested cities in the Ukraine conflict.
