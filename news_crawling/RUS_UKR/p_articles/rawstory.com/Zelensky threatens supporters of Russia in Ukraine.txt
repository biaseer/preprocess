Zelensky's statements referred to recent events in the Russian-occupied territories of the Kherson region in the south of the country.
Those who are tempted by offers from the Russian occupiers were signing their own verdict, he said in a video message. "The verdict is to follow more than 12,000 occupiers who could not understand in time why Ukraine should not be attacked."
There, Russia is trying to "to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo-republics," Zelensky said. "They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe," he said.
The Ukrainian side has said that more than 12,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war in Ukraine. This could not be independently verified.
