NEW YORK CITY, New York: As Ukraine hinted at possible concessions to Russia that could ease tensions between the two countries, on February 14 oil prices eased after earlier hitting a seven-year high.Brent crude was down 81 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $93.63 a barrel by 1259 GMT, off an earlier peak of $96.16, the highest since October 2014.US West Texas Intermediate WTI crude fell 83 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $92.27 a barrel, after hitting $94.94, the highest since September 2014.Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS, said, "Market participants are concerned that a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine could disrupt supply."The oil market is sensitive to any news of potential supply disruptions, he added.Statements from the U.S. about an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine have rattled global financial markets, which later cooled as Ukrainian Ambassador Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine was prepared to make concessions to Russia.Commerzbank, analyst Carsten Fritsch, said, "If Russia invades Ukraine, crude oil and natural gas prices can be expected to surge significantly. In this case, Brent would probably exceed $100 per barrel."As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC, have struggled to deliver promises to increase monthly output by 400,000 barrels per day bpd until March, supplies have been stretched.Pratibha Thaker, the Economist Intelligence Unit's editorial director for Middle East and Africa, said, "Oil prices are once again coming under tremendous upward pressure as OPEC missed its output targets by a high 900,000 barrels in January."Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency's IEA chief, Fatih Birol, urged OPEC to close the gap between its words and its actions.
