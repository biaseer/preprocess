Speaking to the Dali, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said Ireland is calling for a reduction of troops along the Ukraine-Russia border, as Ireland continues to support a diplomatic resolution based on a rules-based international order which respects the territorial integrity of states and democracy, he said.
At the same time, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Russia's threat to invade Ukraine is being taken very seriously by the EU, the U.S. and the UK.
DUBLIN, Ireland: Ireland's top officials are advising the public to avoid travel to Ukraine during the ongoing crisis, as Russia threatens to invade its southern neighbor.
He added that such a threat is why Ireland has been talking about the need to defuse tensions and to focus on diplomacy, as opposed to military build-ups.
Coveney also said the EU is unified about deterrents, which Russia needs to understand will be enacted if it invades Ukraine.
