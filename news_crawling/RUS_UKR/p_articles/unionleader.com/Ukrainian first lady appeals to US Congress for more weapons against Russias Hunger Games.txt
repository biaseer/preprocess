We remain completely broken when our world is destroyed by war. Tens of thousands of such worlds have been destroyed in Ukraine, she said through a translator, in an emotional 15-minute speech to members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.
Theyre not asking for U.S. soldiers. They are asking for U.S. weapons. I think nows the time to put together another aid package to go into 2023 with a supply of advanced weapons and economic assistance to stay in the fight, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said after the speech.
Russia calls its action in Ukraine a special military operation to ensure its own security. Zelensky has led his country in standing up to Moscow.
I am asking for weapons, weapons that would not be used to wage a war on somebody elses land, but to protect ones home and the right to wake up alive in that home, Zelenska said.

How many children like him are there in Ukraine? How many families like this may still be destroyed by war? These are Russias Hunger Games, she said in reference to a series of novels and movies in which people hunt one another.
The United States has provided $8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the war began, including $2.2 billion in the last month, the Biden administration says. Members of Congress responded warmly and said they were ready to authorize more.
Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, showed videos of children she said had been wounded or killed, including a 3-year-old boy now in Germany learning how to use prosthetic limbs.
What we saw here was human tragedy right before our eyes, innocent people murdered. Why? Because they are Ukrainians. Thats genocide. Thats what happened in World War II. And that needs to be stopped, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said.
The answer is right here in Washington, D.C. ... Help us to stop this terror against Ukrainians and this will be our joint great victory in the name of life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness, she said.
