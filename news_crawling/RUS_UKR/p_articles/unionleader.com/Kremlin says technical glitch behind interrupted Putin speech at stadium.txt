Cited by RIA news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a server glitch had caused the interruption.
The Kremlin said on Friday a technical glitch was behind the interrupted transmission of Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech to a packed Moscow stadium to mark the eighth anniversary of Crimea's annexation.
It later aired the full speech, which ended a few seconds after the cutaway with Putin leaving the stage as thousands of spectators waved Russian flags at the 80,000-capacity Luzhniki stadium.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in an effort to degrade its southern neighbours military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.
Russian state television suddenly cut away from Putin hailing what Russia calls its special operation in Ukraine and the bravery of its soldiers, to show patriotic songs being played at the event instead.
