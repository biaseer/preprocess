Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly one month ago, around 10,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Finland, according to data from the Finnish Immigration Service, Migri.
Migri said it is believed that the actual number of new arrivals from Ukraine is much higher as many have not sought asylum status through official routes. Ukrainians are able to enter and stay in Finland for a period of three months, visa-free. siirryt toiseen palveluun
UN refugee agency UNHCR has recently estimated that about 3.5 million people have fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion.
This week, a group of Ukrainian children in Tampere started school, where they are learning the basics of the Finnish language.
News agency STT on Monday reported that they had uncovered evidence that fraudsters were attempting to lure Ukrainians into Finnish jobs that don't exist. International humanitarian groups have warned of human traffickers attempting to exploit the exodus of Ukrainian women and children from the war-torn country.
