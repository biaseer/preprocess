At the time, there were a total of around 5,000 Russian carriages in Finland, most of which were sent back across the border to Russia.
Finnish state railway firm VR Cargo confirmed that authorities seized about 800 Russian freight cars when the sanctions went into effect.
Since the sanctions were imposed, authorities also froze the assets of around 82 million euros from Russian and Belarusian transport firms.
The sanctions were imposed due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began at the end of February.
Finland has seized 865 Russia freight cars since April, when the EU imposed sanctions on Russian coal, according to Russian government documents.
