Demand for strong iodine tablets has been higher than usual since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine, with many pharmacies completely running out of stocks.
In Finland, concerns about Russia's assault on Ukraine have been reflected in the demand for iodine, which can be used to prevent the absorption of radiation.
Finland's Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority STUK on Saturday reported that the safety of Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, has not been compromised.
Radiation levels at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the site of a deadly nuclear disaster in 1986, are also normal, STUK said.
Russian forces attacked the plant early on Friday, causing a training facility near the reactor buildings to catch fire. Rescue workers were able to extinguish the fire around 6am on Friday.
