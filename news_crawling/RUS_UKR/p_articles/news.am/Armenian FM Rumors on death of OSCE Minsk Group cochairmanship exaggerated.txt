Rumors on 'death' of OSCE Minsk Group co-chairmanship format can be considered somewhat exaggerated, said ArmenianForeign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan.
"Due to the Russian-Ukrainian war, the activities of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairmanship, to put it mildly, are inactive," he noted on Wednesday at a meeting of the National Assembly.
But we continue to see the place and format of negotiations on the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict within the framework of the co-chairmanship of the OSCE Minsk Group.
We are constantly talking about this with all international partners and, first of all, with the co-chairs themselves. I must state with pleasure that recently the co-chairing countries have reaffirmed their readiness and commitment to continue work, and in the specified format, Mirzoyan said.
As the FM noted, talks about consensus in the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairmanship would be a clear exaggeration. However, rumors about the death of this format can also be considered exaggerated.
