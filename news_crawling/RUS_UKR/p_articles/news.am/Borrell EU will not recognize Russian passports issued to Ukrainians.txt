The EU will not recognise these passports, Borrell added recalling the position the EU adopted regarding the Russian passports issued in the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics, as well as in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine.
The new Russian legislation now simplifying the procedure for all Ukrainians to obtain Russian citizenship is yet another flagrant violation of Ukraines sovereignty, linked to Russias illegal war. Josep Borrell, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyVice-President of the EU Commission, wrote this on Twitter.
