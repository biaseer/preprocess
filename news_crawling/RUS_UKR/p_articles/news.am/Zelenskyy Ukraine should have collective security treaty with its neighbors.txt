Ukraine is ready to have a dialogue with Russia on security guarantees, but is not ready to capitulate, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
"We cannot recognize that Crimea is the territory of Russia. I think it will be difficult for Russia to recognize that this is the territory of Ukraine. I think we are smart enough to ensure that the decision on these two issues does not cause any revolutions within societies, so that people are satisfied with this decision: both those who live in those territories and those who live in Ukraine," Zelenskyy said, adding that to solve all these issues, Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to start a direct dialogue. "The people who elected me are not ready to surrender, we are not ready for ultimatums. But we can discuss with Russia the future of Crimea and Donbas," he added.
"I have spoken many times about NATO and publicly conveyed messages to both Russia and President Putin: we are ready for any guarantees of our country's security from the respective states that must guarantee. And Russia is also among these states, because Russia is our neighbor," he said.
His remarks came during an interview with ABC News, which was published on the Ukrainian president's website.
He said that in the future Ukraine should have a collective security treaty with all its neighbors and with the participation of the world's leading states - the USA, France, Germany, as well as Turkey, with which the country borders across the Black Sea.
