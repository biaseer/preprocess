According to Lavrov, a possible meeting between Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was not discussed at the Russian-Turkish talks.
According to Cavusoglu, Ankara intends to continue doing everything possible to help resolve the situation in Ukraine.
Lavrov noted that Russia was ready to negotiate with the Ukrainian side only if meetings would lead to concrete results in solving problems. According to him, the Ukrainian leadership wants to meet only for the sake of the picture on TV. "So we have learned a very serious lesson from these manners of Ukrainian leaders. Now we will negotiate meetings that will really have added value on all the key issues that led to the current conflict," the Russian foreign minister added.
"We have not specifically discussed this today, because President Putin and our other representatives have repeatedly touched on this topic in their comments, answering relevant questions," the minister said.
He noted that the Russian side is ready to continue contacts at the level of foreign ministers with Ukraine with the participation of Turkey.
Turkey is ready to host a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.
