Any arms supplies to Ukraine, no matter how Washington argues for them, increase the risks of a direct clash between Russia and the United States, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told RIA Novosti.
He noted that for many years the U.S. did not try to do anything to find a solution to the Ukrainian conflict. And after Russia launched a special military operation "there was simply a breakdown of the remnants of a responsible common sense approach to the situation" - now Washington is trying to do everything to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia.
"Any arms deliveries that continue, are on the rise, increase the risks of such a development," Ryabkov said, responding to a question about whether the risk of an open clash between Russia and the United States would increase in light of Washington's decision to supply Ukraine with HIMARS missile systems.
Earlier, the White House said that the U.S. would unveil a new package of military aid to Ukraine on Wednesday, which would include HIMARS missile systems. It was noted that the US missile systems supplied to Kiev would not be able to hit targets outside Ukrainian territory.
