In a statement, Russia's foreign ministry said: "London's unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for containing our country and strangling the domestic economy" were responsible for its decision.
It added: "In essence, the British leadership is deliberately aggravating the situation around Ukraine, pumping the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the part of NATO."
Russia has banned Prime Minister Boris Johnson and several other UK senior ministers from entering Russia over the UK's "hostile" stance on the war in Ukraine, BBC reported.
The sanctions included financial measures designed to damage Russia's economy and penalize President Vladimir Putin, high-ranking officials, and people who have benefited from his regime.
Moscow said the decision had been made in retaliation to the UK's sanctions against it since it invaded Ukraine.
