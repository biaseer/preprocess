The relations between Armenia and Ukraine are progressing, at least starting from the moment when I was appointed Ambassador of Armenia to Ukraine. This is what Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Armenia to Ukraine Vladimir Karapetyan said during the concluding conference of the Union of Armenians of Ukraine held in Yerevan on Monday.
Nevertheless, as the Ambassador stated, the relations between Yerevan and Kyiv arent only limited to political statements and voting on different international platforms. He also assured that the economic cooperation is also deepening.
According to him, during his term of office, Kyiv has never made statements contradicting the interests of Armenia. I can only say that there is political dialogue, and we are trying to converge our approaches and stances as much as possible, Karapetyan said.
