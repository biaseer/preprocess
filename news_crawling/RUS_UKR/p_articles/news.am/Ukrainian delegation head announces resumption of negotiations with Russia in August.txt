He said that he expects Ukraine's position at the negotiating table to change by August. In his opinion, Kyiv will speak from a position of strength and it is at this time that we should expect a counterattack.
According to the politician, by then Kyiv's "negotiating position" should strengthen after a planned counterattack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the negotiations with the Russian side, Davyd Arakhamia, said in an interview with the Voice of America that Ukraine may resume talks with Russia at the end of August.
