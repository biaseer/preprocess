November 17, 2022 has been chosen as the date for the ruling in the case of the crash of flight MH17, the report said.
The District Court of The Hague will rule on the case of the crash of Malaysian Boeing flight MH-17 on November 17, TASS reported.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the US is withholding facts of colossal importance, which could help learn the truth in the case of the crash of Malaysian Boeing MH-17.
The Malaysian Boeing, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on flight MH17, crashed near Donetsk in 2014. All 298 people on board were killed. Kiev blamed the crash on the militiamen, who said they did not have the means to shoot down the aircraft at such an altitude. The Joint Investigation Team JIT led by the Dutch General Prosecutor's Office is investigating the circumstances of the crash without Russian participation. The investigation claims that the Boeing was shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile system belonging to the Russian Armed Forces.
