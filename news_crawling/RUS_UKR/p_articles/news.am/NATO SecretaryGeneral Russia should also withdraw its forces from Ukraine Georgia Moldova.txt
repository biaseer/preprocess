According to Stoltenberg, Belarusian and Russian troops near Ukraine are on high alert. "Russias military build-up in and around Ukraine continues, with more than 100,000 troops in position, and more on the way, including significant deployments in Belarus," he said.
At the same time, he noted that NATO would not compromise with Russia on the right of any country, including Ukraine, to join the alliance.
"NATO firmly believes that tensions and disagreements must be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy," he said.
Russia should withdraw its forces from Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, where they are deployed without consent of these countries, said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
He added that hoping for the success of political negotiations, NATO is preparing for the worst. According to him, if necessary, an advance detachment of 5,000 people led by France will be deployed to the Black Sea region in a few days.
