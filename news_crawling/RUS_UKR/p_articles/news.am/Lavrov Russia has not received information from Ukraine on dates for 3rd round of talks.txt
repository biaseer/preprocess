Ukraine is constantly making excuses to delay the start of the next round of talks with Russia, said the FM.
"We have spoken, both in the speeches of the Russian President and in the speeches of our delegation in the mentioned negotiations, about the conditions which we consider absolutely indivisible for the settlement of this crisis, in order to eliminate the threat being posed for many years against Russia in the territory of Ukraine by the members of the North Atlantic Alliance," said the Russian FM.
As per Lavrov, the Russian negotiators are still waiting for information from Ukraine, but now the respective situation "seems strange."
"We are ready, as was well known to our Ukrainian colleagues, to move forward last night to hold such a third round," Lavrov added.
Lavrov said that Russia has clearly outlined the conditions it deems necessary for the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Russian side has not yet received information from Ukraine about the dates for the third round of talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press conference on Saturday, TASS reported.
