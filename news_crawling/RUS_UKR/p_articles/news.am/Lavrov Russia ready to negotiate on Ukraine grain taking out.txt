"If it's about the Ukrainian grain, Ukraine should unblock its ports, clear mines or ensure safe passage through minefields. And already outside the territorial sea, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey are ready to ensure the safety of the respective ships and bring them to the Turkish straits and then to the Mediterranean Sea where they will sail in their own course," the Russian FM added.
