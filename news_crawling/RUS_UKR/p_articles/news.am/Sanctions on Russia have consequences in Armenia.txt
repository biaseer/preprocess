After the change of power in Armenia in 2018, the ACP and the Teghut CJSC were transferred to the management of the VTB Bank in exchange for the debt, as Teghut had taken a large loan from VTB to co-fund the construction of the combine and the work of the operation of the mine, and at some point the paying back of the loan had become more difficult due to the fall of copper prices on the world market.
YEREVAN.  Zhoghovurd newspaper of Armenia writes: Zhoghovurd daily has received an alert that the Teghut mine being operated in Lori Province is ceasing its activities for an indefinite period.
In particular, the management provided such information to the employees. The reason, in fact, is the sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation as a result of the Russian-Ukrainian military operations.
As it is known, the owners of the Teghut mine have changed since 2019, and the Teghut mine is now under the control of the Russian VTB Bank. Let us remind you that the Armenian Copper Program ACP the Alaverdi Copper and Molybdenum Combine company, the "Teghut" Closed Joint-Stock Companywhich was operating the Teghut Copper Molybdenum Mine, the Base Metals company of Artsakh Nagorno-Karabakh, etc., were part of the Vallex Group of companies.
