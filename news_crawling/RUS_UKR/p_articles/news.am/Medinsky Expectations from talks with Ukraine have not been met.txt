According to him, the Russian side raised the issue of humanitarian corridors with the Ukrainian delegation. Medinsky expressed hope that the humanitarian corridors would work on Tuesday.
Another member of the delegation, Leonid Slutsky, noted that Russia expects negotiations with Ukraine to continue soon. "But Moscow does not comfort itself with the illusion that there will be a result next time," he said.
In his opinion, the negotiations will not be easy. "Russia expects that the next attempts to evacuate civilians in Ukraine will be more successful," Slutsky added.
He noted that Russia had hoped to sign at least a protocol at the negotiations with Ukraine, but failed to sign anything, TASS reported.
Expectations of the negotiations with Ukraine did not materialize, the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said.
