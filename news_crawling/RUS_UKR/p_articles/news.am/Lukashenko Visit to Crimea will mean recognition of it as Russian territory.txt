Its no secret for me and Putin. Moreover, its simply an issue that doesnt exist, Lukashenko said, adding that he has already received an invitation to visit.
Earlier, Lukashenko had complained that the President of Russia hasnt taken him to Crimea, even though he had promised to show what has been done there, and a lot has been done.
According to the Belarusian president, his visit to the peninsula will mean recognition of Crimea as a territory of Russia.
I have the full-fledged right to visit Crimea, no matter whose protectorate it is or under whose dominance it is. It is also my Crimea. Putin and I have a specific agreement to stay in Crimea, the Belarusian president said, adding that he would like to start his visit from Sevastopol.
If the President has already arrived there Crimea-ed.with the President of Russia. Listen, what other recognition can we talk about? Its crystal clear, as they say in Russia, he said.
In response, Putin had advised his counterpart by saying that whoever hasnt been to the peninsula after it was annexed to Russia, to visit the new memorial complex in Sevastopol dedicated to the end f the civil war.
