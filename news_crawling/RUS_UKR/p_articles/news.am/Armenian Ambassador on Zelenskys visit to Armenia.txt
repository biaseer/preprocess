This goes to show that Kyiv has the desire to deepen the relations between Armenia and Ukraine. Of course, Armenia shouldnt limit itself to such meetings. We need to work on ensuring meetings at a higher level, Karapetyan said.
Its hard for me to say anything about the possible visit of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky to Armenia. This is what Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Armenia to Ukraine Vladimir Karapetyan said during the concluding conference of the Union of Armenians of Ukraine held in Yerevan on Monday.
Nevertheless, according to him, the representatives of Ukraine, namely the ministers and deputies of the Supreme Rada, visit Yerevan, and this is a unique affirmation of the deepening of bilateral relations.
