"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.
United Nations UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said that it is necessary to create conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine. He called for this during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow.
Guterres said that after Russia and Ukraine he is going to visit Africa. According to him, the African region has already faced unequal access to resources during the coronavirus pandemic, and now it is negatively affected by events around Ukraine.
