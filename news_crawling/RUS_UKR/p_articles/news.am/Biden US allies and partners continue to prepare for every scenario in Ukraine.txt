President Joe Biden warned in a statement released during the Security Council debate that Russia would face "swift and severe consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
"Today in the United Nations Security Council, the United States presented in detail the full nature of Russias threat to Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity. And we made clear to the international community the full implications of that threat  not just for Ukraine, but for core tenets of the UN Charter and the modern international order.
If Russia is sincere about addressing our respective security concerns through dialogue, the United States and our Allies and partners will continue to engage in good faith. If instead Russia chooses to walk away from diplomacy and attack Ukraine, Russia will bear the responsibility, and it will face swift and severe consequences.
The United States and our Allies and partners continue to prepare for every scenario. The world must be clear-eyed about the actions Russia is threatening and ready to respond to the risks those actions present to all of us," he said.
According to him, today's Security Council meeting "is a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice: rejecting the use of force, calling for military de-escalation, supporting diplomacy as the best path forward, and demanding accountability from every member state to refrain from military aggression against its neighbors."
