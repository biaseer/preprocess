NATO General Jens Stoltenberg, in an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, said that Russia's false statement about the storage of biological weapons by Ukraine can be used by the Kremlin as a pretext for chemical attacks.
Earlier, the US State Department said that the US does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine.
Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself may be planning chemical weapons operations under this fabricated lie, Stoltenberg said.
He added that the Kremlin is inventing false pretexts, trying to justify something that cannot be justified, Politico reports.
Meanwhile, Stoltenberg once again rejected the idea of creating a no-fly zone in Ukrainian airspace, as that would mean that Russian forces would have to be attacked, and this is fraught with direct confrontation and uncontrolled escalation.
