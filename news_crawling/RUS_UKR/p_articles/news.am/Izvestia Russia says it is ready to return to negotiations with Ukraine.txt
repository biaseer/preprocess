"The negotiation process was not interrupted by us. It was put on pause by our Ukrainian partners," said the diplomat.
According to him, the Russian side will return to the dialogue as soon as Kiev wants to return to the negotiating table.
Moscow is ready to return to negotiations with Ukraine, but on condition that Kiev is ready to do so, the Izvestia newspaper quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Rudenko as saying.
