The US has backed Ukraine's assessment of the incident as the Biden administration and its European allies vowed to send more military assistance to Ukraine. Antonov warned such aid only worsened the conflict and could potentially lead to a direct conflict between the US and Russia.
"We warn that such actions are dangerous and provocative as they are directed against our state," he added. "They can lead the U.S. and the Russian Federation onto the path of direct military confrontation. Any supply of weapons and military equipment from the West, performed by transport convoys through the territory of Ukraine, is a legitimate military target for our Armed Forces."
The senior Russian diplomat said the events of February 24 had roots eight years earlier, when the uprising known to its supporters as the Euromaidan toppled a Ukrainian government with close ties to Moscow and put into power a pro-West administration seeking closer ties with NATO and the European Union.
"The special operation in Ukraine is the result of the unwillingness of the Kiev regime to stop the genocide of Russians by fulfilling its obligations under the international commitments," Anatoly Antonov told Newsweek. "The desire of the NATO member states to use the territory of a neighboring state to establish a foothold in the struggle against Russia is also obvious."
Russia's ambassador to the US has outlined to Newsweek his country's reasoning for launching what it has deemed a "special military operation" against Ukraine, and detailed the demands that, if satisfied, could end the conflict involving Europe's two largest countries, Newsweek reported.
"Western states are directly involved in the current events as they continue to pump Ukraine with weapons and ammunitions, thereby inciting further bloodshed," Antonov said.
