Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will visit Ukraine on 3 February for talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky that are designed to reduce tensions between Kyiv and Moscow, Reuters reported, citing a senior Turkish official.
"Erdogan will convey messages to Zelenskiy on maintaining peace in the region and preventing a rise in tension and hot conflict," the official said.
Erdogan said last week that Russia would be unwise to attack Ukraine, in which case Turkey as a NATO member will do what is necessary.
"We expect both the talks to be effective in lowering tensions between Russia and Ukraine," the official said, requesting anonymity.
He said plans were also being made for Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Turkey following the Winter Olympics, being held in China between February 4-20.
