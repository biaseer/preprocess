Defence Minister Thandi Modise says the ANC-led government will always seek solutions to conflict and avoid war.
South Africa has faced criticism for refusing to support UN resolutions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.
"Our position is that multilateralism remains a central pillar to resolving conflict. We respect and encourage resolutions that rebuild people and nations rather than encourage the might is right phenomenon. As a country, we strongly believe that proxy wars must stop. Our call for the United Nations, especially the Security Council stands."
"We believe that we must continue to choose mediation and peace, it is not always a popular stance. It is easy to make war than face up with your enemy and deal with the root causes of the conflict. Especially where we know that the real victims will be children and women. We need to be brave enough and confront the issues and get the results.
