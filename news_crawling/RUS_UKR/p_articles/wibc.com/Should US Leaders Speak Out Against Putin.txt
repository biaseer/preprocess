I see nothing wrong with the US funding Ukraine to be able to damage Putin but should we as a nation be discussing regime change?
The question Tony Katz prompts is: is this something we should share out loud and through the media? Should our leaders publicly denounce Putin?
As Russia continues its invasion, the US has continued to fund Ukrainian forces with weaponry and detailed intelligence. Our country has provided foreign military financing as well as information regarding intel including Russian aircraft coordinates.
