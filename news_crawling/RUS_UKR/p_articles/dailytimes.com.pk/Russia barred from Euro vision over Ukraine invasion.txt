The announcement came after Russia on Thursday launched a full-scale invasion of its western neighbour.
The EBU is an apolitical member organisation of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service, its statement stressed.
Russian entertainers will not be permitted to take part in this years Eurovision Song Contest following the invasion of Ukraine, the European Broadcasting Union said Friday.
The 66th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest is set to be held in May in Turin after the victory of lederhosen-wearing Italian rockers Maneskin in 2021.
We remain dedicated to protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.
In addition to barring any Russian act from participating, Russia residents will also be blocked from voting in the kitschy competition.
The decision reflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this years Contest would bring the competition into disrepute, the EBU said in a statement.
