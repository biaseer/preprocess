Washington has warned for weeks that Russia could provoke or fabricate an incident in the area to serve as a pretext for invading Ukraine. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told ABC News This Week that Russian President Vladimir Putin has a number of options available to him and he could attack in short order.
I dont believe its a bluff, Austin said, adding, I think hes assembled the kinds of things that you would need to conduct a successful invasion.
The United States, which estimates that Russia has placed more than 150,000 troops near Ukraines borders, has observed significant movements since Wednesday, the official said, insisting on anonymity. Forty to fifty percent are in an attack position. They have uncoiled in the tactical assembly in the last 48 hours, the official told reporters.
