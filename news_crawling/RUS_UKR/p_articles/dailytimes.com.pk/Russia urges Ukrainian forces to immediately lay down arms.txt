The Russian defence ministrys warning came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced late on Monday the start of a new offensive by Moscow, focused on the east of the former Soviet state.
We once again call on the Kyiv authorities to show reason and give the corresponding orders to fighters to cease their senseless resistance, the Russian defence ministry said in a statement.
The Russian armed forces once again offer the nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries a chance to stop all military activity and to lay down their arms, starting at noon, it said.
But it warned that Moscow had real-time proof about terrible new crimes being prepared by the Kyiv regime.
Moscow: Russia on Tuesday called on Ukrainian forces to immediately lay down arms and issued a new ultimatum for the defenders of the besieged port city of Mariupol to give up their resistance.
The defence ministry added that Ukrainian fighters resisting the advancing Russian forces in the Sea of Azov port of Mariupol were in a catastrophic situation.
But, understanding that they will not get such instructions and orders from the Kyiv authorities, we call on the fighters to voluntarily take this decision and to lay down their arms.
