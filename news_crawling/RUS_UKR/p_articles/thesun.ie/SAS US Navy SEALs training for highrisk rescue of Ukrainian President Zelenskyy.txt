Defiant President Zelenskyy has already turned down a US rescue offer  saying: I need ammunition, not a ride.
A senior UK source said: The most likely sensible option could be to relocate Zelenskyy out of Kyiv where he could be picked up.
SAS commandoes and US special forces are training for a high-risk rescue of hero Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sources say.
But the situation has deteriorated and Russian Spetsnaz special forces are said to be targeting the 44-year-old president.
More than 70 UK elite soldiers are said to have joined 150 US Navy SEALs at a remote base in Lithuania to plot the daring night mission.
