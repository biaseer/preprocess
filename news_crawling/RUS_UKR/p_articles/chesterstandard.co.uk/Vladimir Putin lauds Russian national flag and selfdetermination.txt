Vladimir Putin has lauded Russias flag as a symbol of a country determined to defend its interests and remain loyal to traditional values.
In a video address marking National Flag Day on Monday, the Russian President did not mention Russias six-month-old military operation in Ukraine, but echoed some of the justifications cited for sending in troops.

We are firm in pursuing in the international arena only those policies that meet the fundamental interests of the motherland.
He also said Russian schools, beginning in September, will open their school weeks with flag-raising ceremonies and singing of the national anthem.
Mr Putin and other officials have said Russia sent troops into Ukraine effectively as a protective measure against the encroaching West.
The desire to live according to ones will, to choose ones own path and follow it, has become part of the genetic code of our people, he said.
