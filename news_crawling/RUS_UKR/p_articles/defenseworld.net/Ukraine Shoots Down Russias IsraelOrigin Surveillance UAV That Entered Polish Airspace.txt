In 2019, Patriot missile batteries with their powerful radarscame under fire after they missed hitting Yemeni dronesthat eventually struck Saudi Arabias oil installations.
The now-destroyed Russian drone was thought to be inspecting the damage caused by Sundays missile attack on the Yavoriv training center, located just 20km from the border with Poland, a NATO ally. The attacks left 35 people dead and 134 others injured.
Ukraines military has claimed that a Russian surveillance drone crossed into Polish airspace before reentering Ukrainian airspace, where it was shot down.
The destroyed Russian drone is believed to be Forpost UAV, a license-produced version of the IAI Searcher II reconnaissance drone, built by Israel Aerospace Industries IAI. Licenses were sold to Russia in 2015, and the country is now believed to operate several dozens of such drones.
The fully domestic version Forpost-R with a range of 250km made its first flight in late August 2019. Deliveries of the modified UCAVs with reconnaissance and strike capabilities to the Russian armed forces started in 2020.
