Russia's defence ministry says a Russian warship that was damaged by an explosion on Wednesday has sunk.
According to a ministry message, Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, was being towed to port when stormy seas caused it to sink.
The 510-crew vessel was a symbol of Russia's military power, and has led Russia's naval assault on Ukraine.
Kyiv claims it struck the warship with its missiles, but Moscow has made no mention of an attack.
