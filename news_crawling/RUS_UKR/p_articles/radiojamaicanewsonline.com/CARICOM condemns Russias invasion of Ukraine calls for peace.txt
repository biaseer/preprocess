CARICOM, which last week urged all parties involved to act responsibly, said Moscow should cease further actions that may intensify the perilous situation in Ukraine.
The 15-member Caribbean Community CARICOM grouping on Thursday joined the global community in strongly condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and called for an immediate and complete withdrawal of military forces from the Eastern European country.
CARICOM also called for the parties to urgently embark on intensified diplomatic dialogue to immediately de-escalate hostilities and work towards a sustainable peace.
