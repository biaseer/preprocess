Eight people are reported dead in shelling on a residential area and shopping centre in Kyiv.
Ukraine's president has accused Russia of war crimes in Mariupol, where heavy fighting has now reached the city centre.
Ukrainian negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak says the change has helped encourage dialogue between the two sides but any decision on a peace agreement will be made between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.
Ukrainian resilience is reportedly causing Russia to more adequately assess the situation of the war.
Ukrainian authorities say Russian naval forces have shelled some residential buildings on the edge of Odesa.
Meanwhile, Ukraine has ignored Russia's demand for it to give up the city of Mariupol, saying there is no question of any surrender.
