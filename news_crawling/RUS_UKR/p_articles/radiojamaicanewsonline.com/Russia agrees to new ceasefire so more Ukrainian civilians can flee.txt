Russia has agreed to a new 12-hour ceasefire to allow civilians to flee six of the worst-affected areas in Ukraine.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia is holding hostage more than 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocking humanitarian aid and evacuation.
A convoy of evacuees has left the southern city of Enerhodar, and buses are being sent to towns around the capital Kyiv.
But Ukraine says continued Russian shelling has again stopped residents leaving the besieged city of Mariupol and Izyum near Kharkiv.
