Talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives lasted several hours Monday and both sides agreed to meet again in the coming days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address late Monday that he believed Russia's continued shelling was meant to extract concessions from his country, but it wouldn't work.
Perhaps feeling the pressure of Russia being targeted by increasing international scorn and his troops' advance being slowed by fierce resistance from Ukrainian fighters, President Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert on Sunday.
Satellite images showed a 40-mile-long Russian military convoy approaching Ukraine's capital of Kyiv on Tuesday as authorities said Russian forces carried out a deadly attack on the city's main TV tower. The plodding Russian advance on the ground came while Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, was hit by intense shelling as Vladimir Putin's invasion of the neighboring nation entered its sixth day. The U.N. human rights office said Tuesday that at least 136 civilians had been killed by Russia's assault, including 13 children.
President Biden devoted the first 12 minutes of his State of the Union address Tuesday night to the Ukraine invasion. He announced that the U.S. was joining European allies in closing its airspace to Russian planes. Lawmakers from both parties rose to their feet and applauded over and over as Mr. Biden condemned the invasion and lauded the bravery of Ukrainians.
More and more countries and companies worldwide are taking steps to punish Moscow for the invasion. They left Russia's currency, the ruble, plunging to a value of less than a penny.
