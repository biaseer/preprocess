NEW YORK CITY, New York: The Wall Street Journal has reported that Apple has told some of its contract manufacturers that it intends to increase production outside China, citing China's strict anti-COVID-19 policy and other reasons for its decision.The report noted that India and Vietnam, where Apple already has production facilities, are among the countries short-listed by the company as alternatives to China.Due to COVID-19 lockdowns, which slowed production and demand in China last month, Apple anticipates that it will face continuing supply issues.
