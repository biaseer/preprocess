KYIV - Ukraine has requested an urgent meeting with Russia and dozens of other European states to explain Moscow's buildup of forces along the ex-Soviet state's frontier.
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Facebook late Sunday that Russia had ignored Kyiv's formal request for an explanation about why Moscow had positioned more than 100,000 troops and advanced weapons around Ukraine.
"Ukraine is convening a meeting with Russia and all member states in the next 48 hours to discuss the reinforcement and movement of Russian forces along our border," he wrote.
The United States fears that Russia's buildup of forces could lead to an invasion of Ukraine "any day".
