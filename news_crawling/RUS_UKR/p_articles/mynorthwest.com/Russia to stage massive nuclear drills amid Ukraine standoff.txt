The ministry said it planned the maneuvers some time ago to check the readiness of Russias military command and personnel, as well as the reliability of its nuclear and conventional weapons.
Moscow argued that the pullback takes time and rejected Western criticism, saying that it would deploy troops wherever its necessary to ensure national security.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will personally oversee Saturdays exercise, which will involve multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, the Defense Ministry said.
The Black Sea Fleet has surface warships and submarines equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, but its doesnt have intercontinental ballistic missiles and didnt take part in similar previous drills of the countrys strategic forces.
The Russian military said it started pulling some of troops massed near Ukraine back to their permanent bases after the drills. The U.S. and its allies questioned the claim and said that Moscow has actually moved thousands of new troops closer to Ukraine.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin would observe the drills from the Defense Ministrys situation room and supervise the practice missile launches himself.
The Kremlins Peskov said Russia notified foreign partners about the maneuvers in advance, adding that the exercise shouldnt cause worries in the West.
In the past, Russia has held the annual strategic forces drills in the fall. U.S. officials have voiced concern that Moscow shifted the exercise to February to coincide with a possible invasion of Ukraine.
Washington and its allies bluntly rejected the Russian demands, and Moscow threatened to take unspecified military-technical measures if the West continued to stonewall.
