Now its the fifth day of the Russian invasion in our country, Yemetz shared. The first days were really tough because the second day they tried really to occupy Kyiv and they invaded, their forces inside Kyiv, so there were big battles before they invaded, soldiers with tanks.
Dr. Gleb Yemetz is a cardiac surgeon in Ukraine. He has been living with his staff at the clinic where he works in Kyiv since the invasion began, performing emergency surgeries for the critically wounded.

But all of these battles, we won, so there are no Russian forces in Kyiv now, he continued. They are in the suburbs, waiting for the invasion, I think, this night. So were still waiting for air bombs.
Dr. Yemetz describes Russian advances on the city of Kyiv, the situation inside his hospital, and the threat of nuclear war.
