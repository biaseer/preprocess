NBC News reported Friday that Starlink had about 10,000 terminals  the dishes that connect users to Starlink satellites  up and running in Ukraine.
SpaceX didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment about how many Starlink users and terminals are currently active in Ukraine.
Ukraine's digital transformation ministry, which is headed by Fedorov, didn't respond to Insider's request for comment.
Elon Musk's SpaceX now has about 150,000 daily users of its Starlink satellite internet service in Ukraine, a government official said Monday.
In late February, Fedorov reached out to Musk on Twitter to ask the the billionaire to send Starlink terminals to Ukraine. The next day, Musk said Starlink had been activated in the country. The company then continued to send shipments of Starlink terminals to Ukraine, according to tweets by Fedorov.
Fedorov told The Washington Post in late March that his country was using "thousands" of Starlink terminals. Although he didn't disclose the exact number of active Starlink terminals in Ukraine, a person with knowledge of the matter told The Post that there were more than 5,000 in the country  suggesting that the number of Starlink terminals in service in Ukraine doubled in five weeks.
Musk said on March 27 that Starlink had been activated in Ukraine. At the time, Ukrainian government officials were calling for the delivery of more Starlink stations amid concerns that Russia's invasion could disrupt Ukraine's internet services.
Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister, tweeted that Starlink, a subsidiary of SpaceX, was providing "crucial support" for the country's infrastructure and "restoring the destroyed territories."
