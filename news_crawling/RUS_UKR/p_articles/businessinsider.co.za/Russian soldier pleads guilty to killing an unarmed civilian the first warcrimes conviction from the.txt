His conviction is the first from a war-crimes trial linked to Russia's invasion. Ukrainian officials have said thousands more cases are open.
The BBC and Reuters reported his guilty plea on Wednesday, and reported that he could face life in prison if he is convicted.
He was accused of the murder of a 62-year-old unarmed civilian who was on his bicycle Chupakhivka, a village in northeast Ukraine's Sumy region, on February 28.
