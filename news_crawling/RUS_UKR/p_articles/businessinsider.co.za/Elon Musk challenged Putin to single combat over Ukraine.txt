On Wednesday, as SpaceX launched Starlink satellites, the company's launch director said, "Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom."
Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said earlier this month that Russia would no longer send rocket engines to the US in response to sanctions. "Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks. I don't know what," he said.
Musk tweeted: "I hereby challenge Vladimir Putin to single combat. Stakes are Ukraine." He wrote some of the words in Cyrillic script and the rest in English.
Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk bizarrely said in a tweet on Monday that he was challenging Russian President Vladimir Putin to single combat over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Representatives of the two countries are due to meet on Monday for the fourth time to continue talks.
In a follow-up tweet, he tagged the official Twitter account for the Russian presidency and wrote in Russian: "Do you agree to this fight?"
