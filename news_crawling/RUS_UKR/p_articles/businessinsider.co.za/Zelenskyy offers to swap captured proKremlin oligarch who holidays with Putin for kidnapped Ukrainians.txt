In a video address posted on Telegram Tuesday night, Zelenskyy said Medvedchuk was captured while trying to flee the country disguised as a Ukrainian soldier, and that he was open to a trade with Russia.
Ukraine's security servicesaid Tuesday it had captured Viktor Medvedchuk, the millionaire chairman of the pro-Russian political group Ukrainian Choice, with Zelenskyy later posting a photo of him in handcuffs to Telegram.
Russia is believed to have captured thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and sent many to "filtration camps" in Russia.
"I offer the Russian Federation to exchange this guy of yours for our boys and our girls who are now in Russian captivity."
Medvedchuk is close to President Vladimir Putin: The pair have often holidayed together on the Black Sea and Putin is godfather to Medvedchuk's youngest daughter. Like Putin, Medvedchuk has long supported the idea that Ukraine and Russia are indisputably tied together by history.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered Russia the chance to trade a captured pro-Kremlin oligarch and ally of Vladimir Putin for kidnapped Ukrainians.
"I think it is especially cynical of him to use military camouflage. He tried to disguise himself like that. Such a 'soldier.' Such a 'patriot,'" he said.
Zelenskyy also warned that Ukraine would track every person who helping Russia in the war.
"Let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone," he said.
