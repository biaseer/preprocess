It did not specify when and where the swap took place or how many Russian prisoners were released as part of the exchange.
Russia considers the unit a neo-Nazi organisation and has previously said its soldiers should stand trial.
"This is the largest exchange since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. Of the 144 freed, 95 are Azovstal defenders," the main intelligence directorate of Ukraine's defence ministry said on Telegram.
It added that 43 of the freed servicemen belonged to the Azov regiment, a former paramilitary unit that is now integrated into the Ukrainian army.
