Kuleba told reporters that Ukraine had received additional security pledges from the United States on developing defence co-operation.
The United States expressed "unwavering commitment to Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity," State Department spokesman Ned Price said.
Biden is also scheduled to visit a refugee reception centre at Warsaw's national stadium. More than 2 million people have fled the war to Poland, out of the roughly 3.8 million who have left Ukraine all together. Reuters
The White House said that Biden "will deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles".
Biden has held three days of meetings with allies in the G7, Europe and Nato, and visited with US troops in Poland on Friday. He met Polish President Andrzej Duda on Saturday.
"President Biden said what is happening in Ukraine will change the history of the 21st century, and we will work together to ensure that this change is in our favour, in Ukraine's favour, in the favour of the democratic world," Kuleba told Ukrainian national television soon after.
Later on Saturday Biden will give what his aides have billed as a major speech.
Biden dropped in on a meeting between meeting between Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov and US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin.
