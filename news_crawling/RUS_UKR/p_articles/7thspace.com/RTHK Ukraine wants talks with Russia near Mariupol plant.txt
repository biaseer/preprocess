Talks near the sprawling steelworks would provide a dramatic and symbolic backdrop because the site is the last stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the strategic port.
Earlier in the day, Kyiv called for a truce in battered Mariupol for Orthodox Easter, celebrated in both Russia and Ukraine.
"We invited Russians to hold a special round of talks on the spot right next to the walls of Azovstal," said Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The nationalist Azov regiment, at the forefront of the battles with Russian forces, has confirmed that civilians are also trapped in the plant.
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces not to assault the plant this week, but to keep it under siege instead. AFP
"Russia is continuously attacking the Mariupol Azovstal. The place where our civilians and military are located is shelled with heavy bombs and artillery," Zelensky advisor Mikhaylo Podolyak, said on Twitter.
