Astonishing. Complex. Insidious. Startling data. A disturbing connection. A stunning overlap. All this                                     has been said                                     in response to what Ekos pollster Frank Graves                                     found                                     when he examined Canadians attitudes toward Russias invasion of Ukraine: The unvaccinated might be much more likely to hold pro-Russian views than the vaccinated. The most striking finding: Just two per cent of triple-vaccinated and eight per cent of double-vaccinated respondents agreed Russia was justified in invading Ukraine, versus 26 per cent of vaccine refusers.
These beliefs underpin the only solution anyone in government seems to have for this alleged crisis, which is to dramatically diverge from this countrys historical position on free speech  to hold social media accountable, as federal Liberals always put it, and essentially put web giants in charge of determining whats misinformation and what isnt.
There is this infuriating instinct among Canadas chattering classes to assume that any seemingly new, unwelcome phenomenon must have snuck across the border  Canada being too pure of heart to have incubated undesirable opinions all on its own. Paradoxically, many of the same people seem to view pure-of-heart Canada as being completely unable to keep such forces in check before we all slide off the deep end into dystopia.
Thats one way to look at it: That this is a brand-new sickness that crept across the border in recent years and threatens to undermine Canadian democracy. I submit there are much calmer and more reasonable ways to look at it.
This is definitely a new and bluntly insidious force thats contributing to polarization and disinformation and poor decision-making, Graves                                     told the St. Catharines Standard                                    . Canada, once seen as a safe haven from Donald Trump-style disinformation, is quickly catching up, Toronto Star columnist Susan Delacourt                                     fretted                                    . More evidence, NBC senior reporter Ben Collins averred, that antivaxx communities are evolving into general pro-authoritarian spaces.
For starters, there is much to quibble about with Graves methodology. The question about Putins justification mentioned the repression of Russian speakers in the Donbas region, which would tend to nudge less opinionated or informed respondents toward yes. And Graves data suggest unvaccinated Canadians are, in fact, less opinionated: Considerably more of them said they didnt know the answers to his questions, or didnt agree with any of the answers on offer.
Canadians who hate the idea of governments telling them what to do, and people who mistrust modern medicine, are very likely to be consumers of alternative media sources. And those sources tend to question all kinds of mainstream dogma, not least western-dominated narratives about world affairs. This is hardly a new development. There has always been niche, contrarian sympathy for the Soviet Union and Russia in Canada  just as there has been for Castro, Chavez, Pinochet, etc. In the spring of 2015, the Pew Research Center polled residents of 11 countries on the question, Who is most to blame for the violence in eastern Ukraine? Five per cent of Canadians said the Ukrainian government and seven per cent said western nations such as the U.S. and Europe. I dont recall anyone flipping out.
The alternative to the status quo being proposed isnt a return to some pre-internet idyll where everyone was well-informed and compliant. That never existed. Quite the contrary, the internet has been as big a boon to good information as it has been to bad. After two years of treating Canadians like morons, no government official should be surprised if more and more people dont seem to be taking them seriously. No government official has any standing to decide on whats an acceptable opinion and what isnt.
Not knowing what to do about Vladimir Putin is not a disreputable position. Demonstrably, nobody knows what to do about him. Nor is it disreputable not to know whether Putin is committing war crimes another of the Ekos findings where the vaccinated and unvaccinated diverged. Not being an expert on the laws of war, I have no idea. Ekos also asked about a no-fly zone, and the results put vaccine refusers far more                                     onside                                     mainstream public opinion than the triple-vaxxed: 56 per cent of the unvaccinated agreed with Justin Trudeau that NATO shouldnt try to clear Ukraines skies. Meanwhile, 59 per cent of the triple-vaxxed support the no-fly zone. In the current discussion, that practically makes them warmongers.
If this were all the data we had about Canadas vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-refusing populations, it might still be disquieting. But we know quite a bit about those people, thanks to already existing research. Notably, last summer, Abacus Data                                     conducted                                     more than 30,000 interviews  i.e., more than 400 times 75 and also found markedly different attitudes in vaccinated and unvaccinated Canadians. Vaccine-refusers were far more likely even than vaccine-hesitaters to think COVID-19 was hugely exaggerated or an outright hoax 73 per cent vs. 33 per cent, and not to worry about getting COVID-19 69 per cent vs. 27 per cent. Refusers and hesitaters were quite similar on other metrics, however. More than 85 per cent of both groups hate the idea of government telling them how to live their lives, pollster Bruce Anderson wrote in Macleans. The hesitant and refusers are equally likely to try to avoid any prescriptions and vaccines, preferring to rely on their bodys natural defences.
Quibbles aside, however, the most central point is probably this: The sample size of unvaccinated Canadians was 75 people.
Thanks to Frank for asking the questions that unearthed this troubling finding. How to fix this is a big question in 2022. cdnpoli https:t.co7qRp7vftIx
