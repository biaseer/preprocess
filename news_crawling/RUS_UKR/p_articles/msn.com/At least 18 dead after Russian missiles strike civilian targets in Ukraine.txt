"Odesa region. X-22 missiles. Residential building, two recreation centers. 18 people and 2 children died. RF does not 'work on mistakes', it is not a mistake for them. Its a terror tactic: deliberate shelling and mass casualties. To protect people we need anti-missile systems," Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter Friday.
The missiles struck a nine-story apartment building and a resort near the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said. The attack on the residential tower in the town of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi killed 16, and the two people died in the resort facility airstrike. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian cruise missiles were used in the airstrike, which he called a terrorist act.
The attack comes hours after Russian troops withdrew from Snake Island, about 20 miles of Ukraine's Back Sea coast.
The missiles allegedly used in Friday's airstrike are the same type that Russia used in the deadly attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk earlier this week.
A Russian missile attack on Friday killed 18 and wounded dozens more in southern Ukraine, according to authorities.
Ukraine said Russian forces were driven off the island after by Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes, however, Russia claims it decided to withdraw troops as a "gesture of goodwill."
