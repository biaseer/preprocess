The white parachutes of the two pilots are seen in the sky after they eject.
Russia is known to have been targeting Ukrainian rail links in its latest bombardment aimed at paralysing the country in the third month of the war.
The Sukhoi spiralled out of control then hit the ground in a giant fireball after being struck by the Ukrainians while on a bombing mission.
Reports said the drama was near Balakliia, in the Kharkiv region, a key railway junction.
Some accounts said the pilots were later picked up by a Russian helicopter in an emergency rescue swoop to stop them falling into Ukrainian hands.
A pro-Ukrainian report said: 'Information from eyewitnesses. Two helicopters flew to the area of the hit plane, one of them landed twice.
It is as yet unclear how the Ukrainians downed the Su-34 but it is believed to have been a surface-to-air missile.
This is the dramatic moment two Russian Su-34 pilots are seen parachuting from their doomed warplane.
Yet the loss of the plane is another blow to Vladimir Putin's faltering war effort, which is now especially targeting eastern Ukraine.
