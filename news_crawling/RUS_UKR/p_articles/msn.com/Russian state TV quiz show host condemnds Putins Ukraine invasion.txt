'How would she listen to today's information reports about the death of soldiers, about explosions, that civilians in Kyiv and Kharkiv spend the night in the subway, fleeing the war,' he said.
'For me it is absolutely impossible to have fun and joke against the background of a huge tragedy, without noticing what is happening.'
Alexander Gurevich, 57, apologised to fans for presenting the lighthearted Hundred to One show at the same time as Kremlin forces carry out horrors on their neighbouring country.
She would have demanded a stop to a repeat of the scenes of the gruesome Second World War, he said.
In his post, the TV host said he believed game show participants would not want to take part in a fun show during the war.
'Shell explosions, human casualties, people leaving their homes and fleeing the shelling - I apologise to anyone for whom the hilarity of our programme seems, like me, completely inappropriate these days,' he said.
His comments have led to all episodes of the show, similar to Family Feud, being removed from YouTube and he has reportedly resigned from the state TV channel Rossiya 1.
A popular Russian state TV game show host has quit after slamming Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine.
'My late mother-in-law was born in Odessa and lived in Kharkiv for a long time,' he said in his critical comments which were written rather than said on air.
