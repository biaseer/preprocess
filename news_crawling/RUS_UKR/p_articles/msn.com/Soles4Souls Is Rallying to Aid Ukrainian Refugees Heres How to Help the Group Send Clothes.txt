The plan is to start sending product this week, and Soles4Souls already has donations from UggDeckers, Thursday Boots, Under Armour, Bombas, Planet Socks and Third Love.
The group is also seeking to raise at least $50,000 in donations for transportation and other costs. To donate, go here.
Soles4Souls is rallying to help those impacted, and the group aims to send over $1 million worth of new clothes, shoes, underwear and socks in at least three sea containers to partner organizations in Poland and Moldova.
Soles4Souls has a long history of responding to natural disasters. The war in Ukraine and the ensuing refugee surge into Poland, Moldova and other countries in Europe is manmade and all the more catastrophic for it, said Soles4Souls president and CEO Buddy Teaster. Providing essentials like socks, underwear and footwear is critical as families fled with almost nothing. We are proud to work with our partners to provide direct relief to those forced from their homes and cities, and well continue our work in the months ahead as this crisis unfolds.
More than 1.7 million Ukrainian refugees have crossed into Central Europe in the wake of Russias invasion, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
