Around 80 km 80 miles to the east of Chisinau is the Russian-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, which seceded in 1990. It is located between Moldova and Ukraine.
Russia does not rule out the possibility of involving up to 800 servicemen from the unrecognized breakaway state of Transnistria in its war against Ukraine, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on March 9.
Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Transnistria is feared to be the next target of Russia. This narrow strip adjacent to Ukraine proclaimed its independence from Moldova in 1990.
Meanwhile, with Russian forces still stationed in its territory, Transnistria reportedly denied mobilising forces for war with Ukraine.
Russia has not ruled out the possibility of involving up to 800 servicemen from the state of Transnistria in its war against Ukraine, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces was quoted by a news report as saying on Wednesday.
