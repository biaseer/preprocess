Ms Baerbock said it would follow a "European roadmap" in phasing out oil and gas imports.
"Our joint exit, the complete exit of the European Union, is our common strength," she added.
"We will halve oil by the summer and will be at 0 by the end of the year, and then gas will follow," said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.
Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has criticised the stance of both Germany and Hungary who fell short of the restrictions on Russian energy imports announced by the US, EU, and UK.
The EU has said it will switch to alternative supplies and make Europe independent from Russian energy "well before 2030".
Germany has already halted the opening of a big Russian gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, in response to the war.
Earlier this week, German economic institutes warned that immediately halting Russian imports would spark a sharp recession in Europe's biggest economy by 2023.
The US has already banned Russian oil imports, while the UK plans to phase them out by the end of the year.
Germany has said it will stop importing oil from Russia by the end of the year.
Germany currently gets a quarter of its oil and 40 of its gas from Russia and has warned that it could face a recession if supplies suddenly stopped.
