For the third successive day, Russia breached "its own ceasefire agreement" in Ukraine, the United Kingdom's ministry of defence said in a post on Wednesday, adding that the forces have "reportedly disrupted the humanitarian corridors in Mariupol and Sumy". "Shelling and small-arms fire were reported throughout the day althought it's likely that some civilians have been able to successfully flee the besieged cities," a post put up on the Twitter handle read.
