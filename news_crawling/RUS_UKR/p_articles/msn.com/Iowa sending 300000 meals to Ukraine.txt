After sending ballistic vests and helmets overseas to help Ukraine fight off a Russian invasion, Iowa is sending 300,000 meals there to help the humanitarian efforts.
"To our friends in Ukraine, we're sending much love and hope from Iowa, and it's coming soon," Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday at the event.
The Des Moines Register reports hundreds of Iowans helped package the rice and pasta-based meals on Monday and Tuesday.
Reynolds announced earlier this year about plans to send meals to Ukraine through a partnership with Meals of the Heartland. The group sent another 300,000 meals there earlier this month.
These meals will transported to Chicago early next week free of charge through a partnership with Decker Truck Line in Fort Dodge and will then be flown overseas.
