Mexican graffiti artists and muralists unveiled their joint work in Mexico City on Friday in support of the victims of the conflict in Ukraine.
The six murals are painted on a wall decorated in the colours of the Ukrainian flag a few blocks from the Russian Embassy, each featuring Mexican and Ukrainian cultural elements.
The six artists, each adding their own designs with their own distinctive style, sought to create a bond with the Ukrainian community and show their support for peace.
