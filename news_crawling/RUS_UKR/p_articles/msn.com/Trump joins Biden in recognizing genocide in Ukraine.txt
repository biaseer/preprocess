Former President Donald Trump described what is happening in Russia's invasion of Ukraine as "genocide" on Wednesday.
Biden told a crowd in Menlo, Iowa, on Tuesday that a family's budget should not "hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away." White House press secretary Jen Psaki said he was "speaking to what we all see."
The former president previously referred to the conflict in Ukraine as a "terrible atrocity that should never have been allowed to happen" on March 12 and at the time claimed Biden "failed to deter Russia's outrageous invasion of Ukraine."
His statement matches that of the current occupant of the White House, President Joe Biden, who made the declaration last week.
"True words of a true leader," he tweeted. "Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil. We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities."
Russian President Vladimir Putin's withdrawal of Russian forces from around Kyiv, focusing instead on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, has led to the discovery of evidence of civilian mass graves and the torture of captives. Biden's condemnation earned him praise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Biden announced Wednesday that the United States will send Ukraine another tranche of military aid worth $800 million, noting the "steady supply of weapons the United States and its allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion."
"That's genocide," Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity. "What's happening in Ukraine is  people have never seen anything like that before."
