Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov in a briefing video said high-precision weapons and cruise missiles fired from the sea struck the fuel depot near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Thursday night.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has lasted more than a month as Ukrainian forces continue to put up stiff resistance to the assault.
Konashenk said Russia destroyed 24 pieces of military equipment, including seven tanks and five infantry vehicles, during overnight strikes.
