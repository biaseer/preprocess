Christian Siriano is auctioning off a custom blue-and-yellow gown to support the people of Ukraine amid Russias invasion.
The Project Runway alum added to the caption an email address where interested buyers can bid on the full-length gown.
As a designer our voice is our clothes! he captioned the post. So if a few bolts of tulle can help save someone then YES, we will be donating this gown to the highest bidder possible and matching that donation for Ukraine.
Siriano  who is a favourite designer among Lizzo, Ariana Grande, and Oprah Winfrey  is the latest member of the fashion industry to support Ukraine amidst the conflict. Models Gigi and Bella Hadid offered up their earnings from Fall 2022 fashion week to Ukrainian organisations. The creative director of Balenciaga, Demna Gvasalia, dedicated the brands AutumnWinter 2022 show at Paris Fashion Week to the fearlessness, resistance of Ukrainians and the victory of love and peace.
Social media was heartwarmed by Sirianos support, and shared their love for the dress in the comments.
I so hope a celeb gets this and wears on Oscar red carpet, commented one user.
