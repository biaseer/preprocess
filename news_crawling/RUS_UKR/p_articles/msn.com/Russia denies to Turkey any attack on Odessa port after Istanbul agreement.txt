"Russia has denied any attack on Odessa," the minister has made known in statements picked up by 'Hurriyet'.
Turkey's Defense Minister Hukusi Akar said Saturday that Russian authorities have denied involvement in Saturday's attack on the Ukrainian port of Odessa, one of those designated to resume crucial Ukrainian grain exports to needy countries, as agreed Friday in Istanbul.
Although the Russian attack "shows Moscow's real intentions", the minister assured that the shelling "will not stop the work of the Ukrainian authorities.
"We do not trust Russia, but we trust our partners and allies, that is why the Initiative on safe transportation of grain and foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports was signed with the UN and Turkey, and not with Russia," he reminded.
For his part, Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov assured that Ukraine will continue to comply with the terms of the Istanbul pact, for their part.
However, the minister acknowledged that the incident has a "worrying character" given that his country functions as a guarantor of a pact that makes Odessa and two other ports in the country safe zones for grain exports.
Ukrainian authorities have denounced on Saturday the impact of at least two missiles on the city's port, one of those included in the agreement between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN to resume exports.
