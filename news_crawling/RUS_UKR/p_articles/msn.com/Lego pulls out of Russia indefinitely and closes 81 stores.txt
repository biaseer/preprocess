The Danish toy company had already ended its sales into Russia in February, shortly after the invasion began.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the company said: The Lego Group paused shipments to Russia in March. Given the continued extensive disruption in the operating environment, we have decided to indefinitely cease commercial operations in Russia.
Legos decision to close stores is the latest in a wave of economic and social sanctions that have been imposed by companies across worldwide industries since Putin invaded Ukraine.
Joining them in the commercial boycott of Russia until further notice are such diverse brands as Yorkshire Tea, Uniqlo, Mothercare, Heineken and McDonalds.

Much of Russias financial system has also been hit by UK sanctions, including its largest bank, Sberbank, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the countrys sovereign wealth fund.
This includes ending employment for most of our Moscow-based team and our partnership with Inventive Retail Group who owned and operated 81 stores on the brands behalf.
Lego has made the decision to close its shops in Russia indefinitely following Vladmir Putins launch of war on Ukraine.
Britain started its sanctions programme by imposing financial restrictions on 386 members of the Duma, Russias lower house of parliament, after they voted to recognise the independence of Ukraines breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, the prelude to the invasion.
But on 12 July, Lego cut off its partnership with Inventive Retail Group- a local company which runs many of the toy giants stores.
