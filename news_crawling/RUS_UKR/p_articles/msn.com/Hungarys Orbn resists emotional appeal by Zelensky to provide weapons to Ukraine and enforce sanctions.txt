Hungary, alone among EU countries bordering Ukraine, has declined to supply its neighbor with weapons and refused to allow weapons shipments to cross its border into Ukraine.
BUDAPEST, Hungary  Hungarys prime minister on Friday rejected an emotional appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to supply Ukraine with weapons and support sanctions on Russias energy sector.
The rejection came after Zelensky on Thursday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels where he specifically appealed to Orbn, who is widely considered Russian President Vladimir Putins closest ally in the EU and among Europes least enthusiastic supporters of democracy.

Prime Minister Viktor Orbn said in a video posted to social media that Zelenskys requests were against Hungarys interests.
He said that 85 of Hungarys gas and more than 60 of its oil come from Russia, and that blocking Russian energy exports would force Hungarians to pay the price of the war.
