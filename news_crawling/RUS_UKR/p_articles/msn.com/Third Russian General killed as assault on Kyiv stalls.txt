A third Russian Major General has been killed in the Ukraine conflict, landing another blow onVladimir Putin's invasion plans.
"I cannot report about the 6th regiment. Im collecting data. Lots of losses. They waited for us. Head of the convoy got into the ambush. Regiment commander killed in action," a voice, thought to be a Russian officer, can be heard saying on the video.
Major General Vitaly Gerasimov and Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky both died in fighting outside of Kharkiv.
Kolesnikov is the third Russian Major General to be killed by Ukrainian forces since the invasion began 16 days ago.
Putin's planned lightning assault on Ukraine has stalled and Russia has so far failed to take the capital city of Kyiv.
Russian tactics have been called into question after tanks were ambushed outside of Brovay, an eastern suburb of Kyiv.
Russian casualties have been higher than Putin would have expected with an assessment by the United States earlier this week saying both sides had lost around 10 percent of the forces they had committed to fighting.
Ukrainian officials said Major General Andrei Kolesnikov, commander of the 29th army of Russia's eastern district, had been killed.
A video released by Ukrainian authorities show Russian authorities shows tanks and armoured vehicles being repeatedly attacked.
Russian forces are on the outskirts of the city and images released by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed armoured units manoeuvring in and through towns close to an airport on Kyiv's northwest outskirts, site of fighting since Russia landed paratroopers there in the first hours of the war.
