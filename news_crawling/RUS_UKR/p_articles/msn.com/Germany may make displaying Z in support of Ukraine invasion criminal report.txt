German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that the country has considered purchasing a missile defense system to defend itself from a possible Russian airstrike.
A German official said on Monday that residents who displayed the letter "Z" in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine could face criminal charges, Reuters reported.
Russian military officials have used the letter as a marking on their military vehicles during the conflict, while civilians have adopted it as a symbol of support for the Russian invasion.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to stiff sanctions from Western Europe on Moscow, even as it has stirred fears about Russia being a threat to other countries.
"This is certainly one of the issues we are discussing, and for good reason," Scholz said.
