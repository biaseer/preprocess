Ukrainian and Russian forces have engaged in fighting in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where fighting between the two sides has occurred for roughly eight years. Russian forces have most likely won control over the majority of the residential sector of Severodonetsk, the Institute for the Study of War said on Tuesday.
"Only during the liberation of Svyatogorsk 'Sviatohirsk' in Ukrainian in the Donetsk People's Republic, over three days of fighting, the losses of Ukrainian troops amounted to more than 300 nationalists, six tanks, 15 armored combat vehicles of various types, 36 field artillery guns and mortars, four Grad multiple rocket launchers, and over 20 automotive units," it said.
The Russian Ministry of Defense offered a rare insight into its view of how the war in Ukraine is going.
Ukraine's military shares the death toll it has calculated for Russia's military daily, most recently revealing on Tuesday that the other side had lost more than 31,000 troops, while being more selective in sharing that information about its own losses.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that "at least tens of thousands" of civilians have been killed in the three-month-long war, and he said roughly 60-100 Ukrainian soldiers are getting killed daily while 500 are wounded in the Donbas.
Russia's military rarely provides updates on the status of the war, and the entire government has engaged in a coordinated campaign to mislead the Russian people about the actions in Ukraine.
Russia released a statement claiming that Ukraine has suffered "significant losses in manpower, weapons, and military equipment," according to CNN.
