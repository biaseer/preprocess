In a video message posted on Twitter, Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, welcomed the European Unions decision to propose an embargo on Russian oil. He said Ukraine isnt happy it will be delayed for several months, but its better than nothing.

Kuleba said it should be clear now that the time for half-sanctions or half-measures when it comes to sanctions is gone. He said the EU can no longer support Ukraine on one hand by imposing sanctions, while continuing to pay Russia for oil and gas and support its war machine.
