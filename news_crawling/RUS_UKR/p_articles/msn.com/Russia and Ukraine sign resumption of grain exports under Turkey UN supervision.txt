Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement on Friday, mediated by the United Nations and Turkey, to resume grain exports from Ukrainian ports in a solution to the food crisis resulting from the lack of grain in the world's neediest countries.
Under the agreement, a coalition of Turkish, Ukrainian and UN personnel will supervise loading of grain onto ships in Ukrainian ports before sailing a pre-planned route across the Black Sea.
The ships will cross the Black Sea to the Bosphorus Strait in Turkey, where a joint coordination center will be established in Istanbul, including representatives from the UN, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey.
Similarly, the Russian and Ukrainian sides are committed to suspend any attacks on ships or ports involved in these exports.
This center will also be responsible for screening ships entering Ukraine to ensure that they are not carrying weapons or combat material.
Turkish and UN personnel will be in Ukrainian ports to confirm security in the areas protected by the agreement.
