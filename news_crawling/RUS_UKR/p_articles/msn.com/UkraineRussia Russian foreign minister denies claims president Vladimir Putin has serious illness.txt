Russias foreign minister has dismissed claims that president Vladimir Putin is suffering from a serious illness.
The Kremlin has previously dismissed claims that Putin was suffering from Parkinsons disease as absolute nonsense.
Earlier this month, former UK government intelligence official Christopher Steele claimed that Mr Putin is now constantly surrounded by doctors.
The rebuttal comes after weekend reports allegedly from a Russian spy, which claimed that Mr Putin, 69, had three years to live due to a form of cancer. The messages also claimed Mr Putin is losing his sight and suffering from headaches.
In an interview with a French TV station, Sergei Lavrov insisted that the president was in good health.
He said that meetings of the Kremlins security council that are shown to supposedly last for a whole hour are actually broken up into several sections, with Mr Putin receiving medical treatment between meetings.
There has been ongoing speculation about Mr Putins health in recent months after he appeared to be taking extreme precautions, believed to be due to worries over Covid-19, such as seating anyone he met with  even his closest advisers - at the other end of a long table.
Mr Lavrov said: He appears in public every day. You can watch him, read and listen to him. I dont think that sane people can see signs of some kind of illness or ailment. I leave it to the conscience of the liars.
In November 2020, Professor Valery Solovei  a former historian at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations  reportedly said Putin was suffering from both cancer and Parkinsons.
