The ISS is a joint project between Russia, America, Canada, Japan and several European countries.
The moment was live-streamed by both Nasa, the American space agency, and the Russian agency Roscosmos.
It is led by a US-Russian partnership that has continued for two decades despite fluctuating tensions between the two world powers.
The standard-issue Russian uniform is plain blue, and at least one of the men was seen wearing this before take-off.
The three men were the first new arrivals since Russia attacked its eastern neighbour last month.
The three Russians will begin a science mission on the ISS that is set to last just over six months.
A few hours later, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling men floated into the space station one by one wearing bright yellow space suits with blue accents.
"We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it," he joked. "That's why we had to wear yellow."
"It became our turn to pick a colour," Mr Artemyev said when he was asked about the suits in a live-streamed press conference.
Russian cosmonauts have arrived at the International Space Station wearing Ukrainian colours, in what appears to be a statement opposing the invasion.
Russian cosmonauts Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov docked at the ISS after a three-hour flight which blasted off from a Russian-owned facility in Kazakhstan.
Since the invasion of Ukraine, people around the world have used the colours of its national flag to show solidarity and support.
They will replace three current crew members who are scheduled to fly back to Earth on 30 March.
They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their fellow American, Russian and German crew.
