On August 5, Tom Bullock shared a photo of the intercontinental ballistic missile carrier ICBM, also known as the 'doomsday' vehicle, on his Twitter with the caption: "Recent car crash in Russia."

The empty shells of the missiles are filled with water or sand which replicates the weight of a proper missile and allows the drivers of the vehicle to learn how to drive the truck with a heavy load and practice safe ways to brake.
