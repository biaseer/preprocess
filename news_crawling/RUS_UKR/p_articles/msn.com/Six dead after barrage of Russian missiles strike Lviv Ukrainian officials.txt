Russian military forces launched a barrage of missiles at the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Monday, killing at least six people and leaving 11 injured, according to reports.
Three of the missiles hit military infrastructure resulting in fires, according to the head of the Lviv Regional Military Administration.
Five powerful missile strikes at once on the civilian infrastructure of the old European Lviv, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Twitter after the attack. The Russians continue barbarically attacking Ukrainian cities from the air, cynically declaring to the whole world their right to  kill Ukrainians.
The Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security just outside of Lviv was also targeted by cruise missiles in March, killing more than 30 people.
Lviv, about 40 miles from the Polish border, has become a refuge for Ukrainians fleeing parts of the country that have been harder hit by Russian artillery and airstrikes. More than 200,000 have temporarily settled in the western Ukrainian city since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.
In March, multiple Russian cruise missiles struck an aircraft repair facility adjacent to the city's international airport, according to Ukrainian officials.
Five missiles were a part of the attack targeting a railway facility in the outskirts of the Lviv, and a child was among the injured, according to reports. A tire fitting shop and about 40 cars were also destroyed in the airstrike, according to the mayor of Lviv. A restaurant and mini market were located inside the targeted rail station, according to a local police officer.
