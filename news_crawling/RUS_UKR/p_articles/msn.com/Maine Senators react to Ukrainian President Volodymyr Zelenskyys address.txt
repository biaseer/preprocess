AUGUSTA, Maine WABI - We spoke to both Senators Susan Collins and Angus King today about President Zelenskyys speech.
Zelenskyy galvanized the entire room of members of congress, said Sen. Susan Collins. He was so impassioned, he was so strong. And we know that he is the number one target of the Russians. I think we should respond to his call for action, with the exception of that no-fly zone which could lead to a very broad war in Europe. But other than that, I thought what he asked for was reasonable and much needed.
I thought President Zelenskyy was very effective when he reminded us of Pearl Harbor and September 11th when we were under attack, to sort of bring home to the audience, principally members of congress, that this isnt some academic faraway thing, said Sen. Angus King. This is something that weve experienced here in America. And he stressed the point that whats really at stake here is purely, honestly Ukraine, but its also western values. Values of democracy and freedom.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin still says his military operation is going according to plan.
Now Russian and Ukrainian officials have signaled progress towards a possible compromise in ongoing peace talks.
