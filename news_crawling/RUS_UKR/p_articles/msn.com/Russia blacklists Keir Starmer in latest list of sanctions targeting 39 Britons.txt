Given Londons destructive drive to spin the sanctions flywheel on far-fetched and absurd pretexts, work on expanding the Russian stop-list will continue, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Mr Starmer is barred from entering the country for supporting the demonisation of Russia and its international isolation, said Moscow.
It is the latest in a line of sanctions imposed against prominent British figures by Russia, since it invaded Ukraine back in February. Moscow has pledged to continue adding names to the list.
The list also includes Labour frontbenchers Lisa Nandy and David Lammy as well as former prime minister David Cameron, ITVs Robert Peston, the BBCs Huw Edwards and Piers Morgan.

Labour leader Keir Starmer is on a list of British politicians, journalists and business leaders barred from entering Russia in sanctions announced by Moscow on Monday.
The Labour leader has previously called for British sanctions imposed on allies of Vladimir Putin to go further and faster in order to cripple Russias ability to function.
The Talk TV host took to Twitter to respond, claiming: It wasnt on my immediate vacation to-do list.
