Kyiv Saturday renamed an iconic Soviet-era arch symbolising ties with Moscow to Arch of the Freedom of the Ukrainian People, the mayor said.
Users have voted for the Minsk station to become Warsaw station, and for the Leo Tolstoy Square stop to instead celebrate Vassyl Stus, a Ukrainian dissident who died in the Soviet gulag.
Many Kyiv residents have called for plaques across the city linked to Russia and its ally Belarus to be replaced.
The arch is an imposing 35-metre-high monument that towers over central Kyiv.It was erected in 1982.
