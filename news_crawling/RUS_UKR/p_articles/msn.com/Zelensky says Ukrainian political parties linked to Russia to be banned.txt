"Any activity of politicians aimed at splitting or collaborating will not succeed," Zelensky added. "But it will get a tough response."
"Given the full-scale war waged by the Russian Federation and the ties of some political structures with this state, any activity of a number of political parties during the martial law is suspended," Zelensky said during his address.
The 11 banned parties included the Opposition Platform-For Life, Shariy Party, Nashi, Opposition Bloc, Left Opposition, Union of Left Forces, State, Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, Socialist Party of Ukraine, Socialists Party and Volodymyr Saldo Bloc, according to Axios.
During a Sunday interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Zelensky warned of the possibility of a third world war happening if negotiations fail to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In a speech posted online, Zelensky said that Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council agreed to suspend the activities of the parties.
