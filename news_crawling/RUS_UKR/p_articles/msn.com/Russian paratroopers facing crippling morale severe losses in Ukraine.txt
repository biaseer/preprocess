Russia has been increasingly using contracted professionals - contraktniki in Russian - to replace conscripts in elite military units.
After severe losses suffered by the Russian paratroopers as a result of clashes with Ukraine's army, the command of the airborne troops is attempting to restore the morale and combat capability of the units, the statement explained.
Members of Russia's general staff in Ukraine were instructed to investigate each case of refusal and persuade the commanders to return to their units by promising social benefits and government awards.
The 331st was also a showcase for Russia's policy of replacing national service soldiers with professionals under contract. It is understandable why the generals should have given it an important role in the invasion.

Special focus is being put on units in which more than 60 percent of personnel were killed in action and units in which demoralized soldiers have refused to continue their service.

Due to the alleged mass refusal of Russian Airborne Forces VDV officers to participate in combat in Ukraine, Russian paratrooper command has begun trying to hire contractors to fill the vacant positions, but even they do not seem keen to fight, Ukrainian Intelligence said in a statement Saturday.Russia has been increasingly using contracted professionals - contraktniki in Russian - to replace conscripts in elite military units.After severe losses suffered by the Russian paratroopers as a result of clashes with Ukraine's army, the command of the airborne troops is attempting to restore the morale and combat capability of the units, the statement explained.Special focus is being put on units in which more than 60 percent of personnel were killed in action and units in which demoralized soldiers have refused to continue their service.The biggest issue for the Russian forces seems to be the mass refusal of the command staff of VDV units to participate in the fighting in Ukraine. Even contract workers, who were urgently assigned officer ranks, have reportedly refused to fill in positions from platoon commander to battalion commander.
