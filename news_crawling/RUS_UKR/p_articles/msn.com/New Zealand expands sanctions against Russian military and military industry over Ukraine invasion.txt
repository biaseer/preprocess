"The Russian Sanctions Act was passed last March by the New Zealand Parliament and allows for measures such as travel restrictions, freezing of assets and accounts and bans on financial transactions," he said, according to a statement from the Ministry.
Thus, he indicated that the reports of "atrocities and damage caused by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine are worrying". "By sanctioning these entities we are doing our part in condemning the source of this illegal aggression," he said.
In addition, the measures imposed by the Government prevent New Zealanders or New Zealand companies from delivering goods and services to the Armed Forces or other defense entities affected by these sanctions.
New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced Monday that the country has decided to impose further sanctions against the Russian Armed Forces and military industry in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, which began more than five months ago.
"These companies develop communication systems, technology and weapons," he added, before clarifying that some of those affected are the Russian Railways and the SOGAZ insurance company, among others.
In this sense, he described the invasion as "illegal" and "unjustified" and indicated that Russia manages to pull it off "given its extensive military industrial complex, which includes numerous defense entities".
"President Vladimir Putin and the Russian Army are responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, which is a serious violation of international law," she said.
