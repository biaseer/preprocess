Post opinion writer Benjamin Wittes, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution research center, posted video of the cat and mouse game Wednesday night as it unfolded. The team shining the yellow and blue flag noted that the white light was somewhat washing out the blue half of that projection. Protesters responded by increasing the intensity of their spotlight by activating additional lamps.
There was a geopolitical light show in D.C. where protesters projected the Ukraine flag onto the side of the Russian embassy.
A similar protest against Russian President Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine took place last month in Portugal when anti-war protestors shone a Ukrainian flag onto the Russian capitol in Lisbon.
I dont want to make it comfortable to be a Russian diplomat in the United States right now, Wittes said on video posted to Twitter.
A voice off-camera can be heard saying, Theyre trying to drown you out! prompting the projectionist to move the Ukrainian flag all around the front of the embassy while the white spotlight tried to keep up. The Washington Post reports that the Ukrainian flag was beamed onto the embassy from across the street using 14 theater stage lights.
Footage making the rounds on social media also show a white spotlight, seemingly coming from embassy grounds, being used to white out that flag.
Russian troops rolled into Ukraine on Feb. 24, where they were met with unexpectedly firm resistance. They failed to capture the capitol city of Kyiv, but continue pounding military and civilian targets, primarily in the eastern portion of its neighbors land.
