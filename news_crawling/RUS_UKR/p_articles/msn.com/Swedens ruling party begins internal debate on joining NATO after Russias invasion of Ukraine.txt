Ulf Kristersson, leader of Sweden's opposition Conservative party, has said he would apply to join NATO if he wins a majority in parliament.
Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have begun an internal debate about joining NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"We have to seek a broader understanding of what is happening in the world around us and understand the advantages and disadvantages of the current security policy line," Baudin said.
The issue is also set to be a major campaign issue in the upcoming Swedish general election on 11 September.
Russia meanwhile has warned Finland and Sweden against joining NATO, arguing the move would not bring stability to Europe.
Deputy party leader Tobias Baudin said Monday's debate will be a "broader discussion than just a yes or no question on NATO membership".
Members of the party -- who have previously opposed Swedish membership of the alliance -- have met to discuss the country's strategic situation.
The "security policy dialogue" should be completed before the summer, he added in a statement.
Support for membership almost doubled since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, jumping to almost 50 in Sweden and 60 in Finland.
Neighbouring EU member state Finland is also set to decide on joining the military alliance by the summer.
Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said in a u-turn last month that she "does not rule out" a bid to join NATO.
