Twin brothers Andrew and Olexa are chatting with friends as they wait to sign up.
Volodymyr is just 19, but says he's not worried about being put in harm's way.
Like many Ukrainians, he didn't believe Russia would actually invade his country. He thought it was all bluster. Now, he's angry.
"I haven't done military training, I'm not a soldier, but I'm told there are instructors wholl provide training," says Andrew.
"Ukraine is calling. We have to go and defend our homeland any way we can," he says.
The software engineer has no experience with firearms but tells me he's quite handy with a Molotov cocktail, having participated in the Maidan revolution of 2014.
My translator replies, "you're so young, you might be useful for Ukraine in the future too."
Alexander is a builder. The 51-year-old thinks he'd be useful to the armed forces as a driver.
But outside a military facility on the edge of the city, there are dozens of people standing in line. They're waiting their turn to provide paperwork and register as a volunteer for the civil defence force.
It's unusual to see a crowd anywhere in Lviv at the moment. With air raid sirens going off every few hours, most people remain at home.
"There is a little bit of fear, of course. The situation might be unpleasant but sitting in the basement is not an option any more."
"I cant sit at home watching this happen. I'm ready to defend my land, my family. If I die, I will take 10 of them with me," he says.
