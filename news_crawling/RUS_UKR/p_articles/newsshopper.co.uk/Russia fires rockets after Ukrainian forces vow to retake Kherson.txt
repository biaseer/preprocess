It is important that the Ukrainians stop their shelling of the station and provide security guarantees to members of the mission. An international team cannot be sent to work under continuous artillery shelling, he was quoted as saying by Russian state news agency Tass.

Russian forces have fired rockets on the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine, killing at least one person.
As fighting steps up in southern Ukraine, concern has grown about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is held by Russian forces and has been hit by sporadic shelling.
Both Ukraine and Russia blame each other for the attacks, which officials say have damaged monitoring equipment and could lead to a nuclear catastrophe.
The Ukrainian emergency service said one person was killed in shelling early on Sunday of the settlement of Bereznehuvate.
The area is just to the north of the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, which Ukrainian forces have vowed to retake.
Russias envoy to international organisations based in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, called on Ukraine to stop attacking the plant in order to allow an inspection mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
