Seventeen people were killed and 42 injured in two Russian attacks in Kharkiv, Ukraines second largest city, on Wednesday and Thursday, the regional Ukrainian governor said. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians in what it calls a special military operation in Ukraine.
Kharkiv, some 15 km 9 miles from Russian front lines, has been consistently shelled since the start of Russias invasion of Ukraine as it is within range of most Russian artillery, it said in a daily intelligence bulletin.
Reuters      Russia is keeping up steady bombardment of the northeastern Kharkiv front to tie down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from being used for counter-attacks in other regions, Britains defence ministry said on Friday.
