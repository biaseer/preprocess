Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbours military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.
It did not give a reason for the exercises or say when they had been planned.
Separately, 20 Su-27 fighters and Su-24 front-line naval aviation bombers conducted planned combat training overnight, simulating attacks on low-speed air and ground targets, command posts and military equipment in Kaliningrad, Interfax said.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned European countries on Wednesday against any potential action against the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, saying this would be playing with fire.
Reuters      Russia staged war games on Saturday in Kaliningrad  an enclave  on the Baltic Sea sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania   Interfax news agency cited the Baltic Fleet Command as saying, days after a senior official warned European countries against any potential action against Kaliningrad.
Up to 1,000 military personnel and more than 60 military equipment units were involved in the control checks, Interfax news quoted the Russian Baltic Fleet Commands press service as saying.
The West has imposed sweeping sanctions in an effort to force Russia to withdraw its forces, and NATO has beefed up its defences on its eastern flank.
