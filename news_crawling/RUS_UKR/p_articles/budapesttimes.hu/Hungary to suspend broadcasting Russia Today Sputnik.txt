The two channels were on offer with one television provider only in Hungary, which has been warned of the measure, NMHH said. Online outlets are monitored for compliance constantly, it said.
The European Council on Tuesday approved regulation suspending the broadcast of those channels uniformly in all EU member states, citing Russias disinformation campaign in connection with the war in Ukraine, NMHH said in a statement.
