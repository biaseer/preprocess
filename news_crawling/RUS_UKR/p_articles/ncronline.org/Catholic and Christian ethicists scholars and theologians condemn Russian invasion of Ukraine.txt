"This long-planned military assault against a democratic, independent, European sovereign state is a flagrant violation of international law, and undermines the founding principles of the United Nations Charter," the ethicists wrote.
A loose collection of Catholic and other Christian ethicists, scholars and theologians has released a statement condemning Russia's "brutal, wholly unprovoked and unjustified" invasion of Ukraine.
The 375-word statement, posted on the group's Facebook page and online at catholicmoraltheology.com, as of March 4 had garnered the signatures of 128 Catholic scholars and ethicists from other Christian denominations. Notable signees include theologians such as Fr. Bryan Massingale of Fordham University M. Shawn Copeland, former president of the Catholic Theological Society of America and Jesuit Fr. David Hollenbach, the Pedro Arrupe Distinguished Research Professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.
Rebutting Russian President Vladimir Putin's claims that he launched a "special military operation" in self-defense to demilitarize Ukraine and hasten its "denazification," the statement from Ethicists Without Borders declares "there can be no credible ethical justification in defense of this attack."
