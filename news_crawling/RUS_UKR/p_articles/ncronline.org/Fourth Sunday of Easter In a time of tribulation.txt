Today's Gospel sounds so simple: "My sheep hear my voice. I know them and they follow me." There are times when it does feel just that clear and easy.
On the other hand, the Book of Revelation tells us that discipleship develops by passing through a time of great "tribulation," and the Acts of the Apostles is full of warnings that faith communities will be tested by internal divisions even as their very character seems to be challenged by new members from every land.
