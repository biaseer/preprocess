The Russian invasion of Ukraine is the first war in Europe of the 21st century. As such, it poses unique challenges to the world. And the pope, the most universally recognized voice of moral authority in the world, must find his voice and calibrate it to meet those challenges.
The rise of ethno-nationalism has challenged the vision of a peaceful, unified Europe for which the Vatican has so long labored. Hungarian President Viktor Orban is a thug but he has not invaded his neighbors. Brexit was dumb, not murderous. The violence of the attack on Ukraine makes the pope's moral voice even more necessary.
The first fact that commands attention is that the aggressor is also a nuclear power. Any steps that escalate the war must be weighed against the possibility that such escalation might entice Russian President Vladimir Putin to order the use of nuclear weapons. That line has not been crossed since 1945 and it must not be crossed ever again. Russia analyst Fiona Hill has warned that Russia's hypersonic nuclear missiles are a real threat. The pope needs to speak, and speak clearly, to stigmatize any recourse to even tactical nuclear weapons.
