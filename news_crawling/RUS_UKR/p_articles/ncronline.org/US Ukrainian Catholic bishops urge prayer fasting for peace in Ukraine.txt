In recent days, a number of countries, including the U.S., the United Kingdom and Germany, have urged their nationals to leave Ukraine.
"We ask that each pastor and community, each family and each person, participate in this vigil in whatever way is possible for them," said the bishops. "May our churches be open throughout the day, may the prayer of the church interchange with personal contemplation.
Also signing the letter were: Bishop Paul P. Chomnycky of the Eparchy of Stamford, Connecticut Bishop Benedict Aleksiychuk of the Eparchy of St. Nicholas in Chicago Bishop Bohdan J. Danylo of the Eparchy of St. Josaphat in Parma, Ohio and Auxiliary Bishop Andriy Rabiy of the Archeparchy of Philadelphia.
"Conduct and participate in services, pray the Jesus Prayer, the Marian rosary, the Paraclesis a prayer service of supplication, sit with the Scriptures. Fast in order to focus on the hope that only God gives."
Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, while launching large-scale joint maneuvers with neighboring Belarus Feb. 10.
PHILADELPHIA  As fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine continue to mount, the Ukrainian Catholic bishops of the U.S. have called for a three-day prayer vigil "for peace and the conversion of the hearts of those who preach violence and escalate war."
The appeal, directed to Ukrainian Catholic faithful and "to all people of goodwill," was issued in a Feb. 12 letter signed by Archbishop Borys Gudziak, who heads the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia and is metropolitan archbishop of Ukrainian Catholics in the U.S.
