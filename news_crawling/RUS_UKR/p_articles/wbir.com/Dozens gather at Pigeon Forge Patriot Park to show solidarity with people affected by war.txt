PIGEON FORGE, Tenn.  Blue and yellow flags were seen waving at Patriot Park on Friday, as people gathered to show their support for the people of Ukraine as they fought back against a Russian invasion.
Organizers planned for people to sit or stand in the grass around the park, displaying flags and signs that condemned the war. They listed three specific reasons for gathering:
Everyone who attended the event showed support for the country, and no counter-protestors were seen. Organizers also set up a fundraising campaign on social media for a nonprofit working to help people affected by the war.
They also organized a prayer circle, where people could spend a few moments in silence and pray for Ukraine and the people whose lives have changed because of the war.
