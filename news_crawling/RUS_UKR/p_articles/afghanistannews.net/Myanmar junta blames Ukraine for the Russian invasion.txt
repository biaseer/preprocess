On the other hand, according to the author, Zelensky is "incapable and lacks rationalism," failings that have resulted in the destruction and casualties that his country must now endure.
The two-page commentary, titled "Lessons from Ukraine for Those Who Haven't Learned from History," was written by a writer using the pseudonym "Myint Myat."
"It is not incorrect to say that the Ukrainian people are also to blame for what is happening now because they chose the wrong leader," he adds.
The regime also accused the US and its NATO allies of plotting to pit Russia and Ukraine against each other in a commentary published in its Burmese-language mouthpiece Myanma Alin.
YANGON, Myanmar - Myanmar's military junta reiterated its support for Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, blaming the invasion of Ukraine on the country's leader and people.
While referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a puppet of the West, the author praises Putin as a visionary leader who had the foresight to build up his country's military and economic strength quietly.
