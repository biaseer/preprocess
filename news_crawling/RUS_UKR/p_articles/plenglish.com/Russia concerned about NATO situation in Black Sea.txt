The Russian deputy foreign minister also warned that in addition to Ukraine, the Atlantic Alliance has already included two other Black Sea states: Bulgaria and Romania, in its military plans, so by declaring itself concerned about Russias presence in the region it is actually projecting military force.
Mr. Grushko recalled the Russian Navy and Army have remained on that peninsula since the 18th century. Planes showed up later, but in any case, the Russian military presence was always powerful, it was a factor of peace and security in the region.
Speaking at the Valdai International Debate Club, Grushko stated speculation about militarization of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea is an exaggeration.
