The press release issued by the press service of the Ministry of Defense states that the telephone dialogue between the two is the first one since the beginning of the military operation on Ukrainian territory on February 24.
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, located in the southeast of Ukraine, near the Ukrainian city of Energodar, has been under the control of the Russian military since last March.
In recent weeks, Russia and Ukraine have been accusing each other of shelling the plants facilities.
Moscow claims that its military presence at the plant is aimed at preventing leakage of nuclear and radioactive materials.
He also stressed the importance of the visit of a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA to the nuclear power plant and expressed Moscows readiness to provide all necessary assistance to the organizations inspectors.
Shoigu, the text adds, informed his French counterpart of the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces, capable of undermining the safe operation of the largest atomic power plant in Europe.
