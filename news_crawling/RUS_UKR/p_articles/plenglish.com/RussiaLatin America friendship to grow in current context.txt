The official stressed that Latin American countries, particularly Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, are friends of Russia. And friendship is worth a lot. And we will strengthen that friendship, he said in response to a question on bilateral cooperation in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
He also warned that the Los Angeles meeting had a truncated format, because the United States did not send invitations to Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, abusing its rights as the organizer, while the leaders of El Salvador and Guatemala did not attend either.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry representative, the practical results of the Summit of the Americas showed that debates were on very specific, not global issues, which is not a coincidence, because such issues, which used to be taken into account in bilateral relations, are impossible to address now.
Schetinin called attention to the fact that Washingtons priorities were evident both in terms of the agenda and the guest club, including business people, media and non-governmental organizations.
We are in no way putting Latin Americans in the dilemma of whom they are with. The major thing for us is the positive context, the positive development of relations that exist and will develop, Schetinin told TASS news agency at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum SPIEF.
