Moscow added that it will not be the first to impose restrictions on the entry to its territory, although it did not rule out that it could respond symmetrically to all measures against it.
The Ministry added that Russia will also avoid introducing the visa regime for Ukrainian citizens, despite the current geopolitical situation.
Following a request by the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples Republics to repel an attack by Kiev, on February 24 Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation in southeastern Ukraine.    Several countries have condemned Russias actions in Ukraine and have enforced several sanctions on its officials to inflict as much damage on the Russian economy as possible in an attempt to pressure Moscow to stop the military operation.
According to the Foreign Ministry, Russia has no intention of distancing itself from the rest of the world and changing the rules of entry, and for this reason it continues implementing all the laws and regulations in force.
