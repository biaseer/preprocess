Moscow holds over 100,000 soldiers close to the Ukrainian border, but denies having plans to attack, saying its troops are moving for purely defensive purposes.
The British government, the United States and the rest of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO accused Russia for possible attack on Ukraine, whose government requested NATOs membership.
Speaking to Parliament on Monday, Ms. Truss stressed that if alleged attack on Ukraine occurred UK would freeze Russian companies and businessmens assets in Great Britain, bar those individuals from entering the country and prevent the British business sector from doing business with them.
Amid escalating tensions with Moscow, London sent 2,000 light anti-tank weapons to Kiev as well as military personnel to train Ukrainian soldiers in their handling.
According to Ms. Truss, the law will come into force coming week, and it will be the toughest sanctions UK has ever imposed on Russia.
