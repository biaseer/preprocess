Peskov thus responded to the request to comment on the statements made by State Department Spokesman Ned Price, who described Shoigus report on the liberation of Mariupol from Ukrainian troops as misinformation.
According to his report, the remnants of Ukrainian forces took refuge in the Azovstal steelworks. He also clarified that a truce was declared and humanitarian corridors were announced so that civilians who could be inside the factory could leave, but nobody did.
These statements have nothing to do with the truth. We suggest that everyone take into consideration the information provided yesterday by the Ministry of Defense and the one communicated by Minister Sergei Shoigu at a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, he pointed out at a press conference.
