According to the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, that is a reflection of the interest in derailing the chances of a peaceful settlement, as well as an attempt to prove by force on the battlefield that Russia is wrong.
He recalled that since that time the bilateral dialogue was put on pause, due to the incitements sent to Kiev by its supervisors, puppeteers of the West.
The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister warned that on more than one occasion Moscow also warned that convoys with weapons for Kiev would be legitimate targets for the Kiev Armed Forces.
Riyabkov confirmed that negotiations between Moscow and Kiev are currently frozen by the decision of the Ukrainian authorities.
He further stated that his country considers it extremely negative that the United States supplies Ukraine with heavy weapons, including multiple rocket launchers, a position that the Russian side communicated to Washington repeatedly and in different ways.
We hold them fully responsible for the fact that peace has not yet come to the land of Donbass, to the land of Ukraine, that we have not been able to move forward on the negotiation track actually since mid-April, he told Rossiya 1 TV channel.
