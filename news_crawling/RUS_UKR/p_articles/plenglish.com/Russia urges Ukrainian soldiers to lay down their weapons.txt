He added that they consider the refusal of Ukrainian soldiers to defend the unwanted Kiev regime led by nationalists the only right thing to do and not back away, urging them to stop thoughtless resistance and save their lives.
He explained that nationalist groups on Monday blew up a bridge over the Donets River to prevent the withdrawal of battalions of the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade and the 81st Air Mobile Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which abandoned equipment, weapons and scattered along the coast, in the onslaught of the Russian units.
He also noted that the Moscow troops are currently completing the liberation of the Kiev units from the locality of Svyatogorsk in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic DPR and its surroundings.
The senior Russian officer warned that the Armed Forces of his country will guarantee all Ukrainian fighters and members of the Territorial Defense Units who voluntarily lay down their weapons a dignified treatment and return to their families.
Konashenkov said that up to 80 Ukrainian servicemen swam across the river, and no Russian soldier fired at them.
