Both agreed that finding a diplomatic solution to the current tensions must remain the main priority, the press release said.
London, Washington and the rest of NATO members accuse the Kremlin of preparing an invasion against Ukraine, whose government applied for membership in the US-led military alliance.
At the same time, they stressed that NATO must stand united in the face of a alleged Russian aggression, and pledged to continue working together to create a package of sanctions that would be applied against Moscow in case of an attack.
Moscow maintains more than 100,000 soldiers in the vecinity of the Ukrainian border, but denies having plans to attack, and assures that its troops are moving within its own territory for purely defensive purposes.
According to Downing Street, Johnson and Macron talked by phone this Saturday on the situation around this Eastern European country, and updated each other on their respective efforts, including the visit if the UK Prime Minister to Kiev,  earlier this week.
