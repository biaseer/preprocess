He reported that he recruited about 800 young men for the Azov Battalion via Internet.
The young man confessed that a man named Vlad, in contact with the neo-Nazi battalions, forced him to carry out the attacks.
In his statements, he spoke about the terrorist attacks that were being prepared in schools of the Russian regions of Tatarstan and Perm earlier this year.
According to Vesti television channel, the accused is a recruit of the ultra-nationalist Azov and Donbass battalions from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, who arrived in Russia under the guise of a refugee.
He further said that he had been nine years looking for volunteers for those groups on social media and among his acquaintances.
