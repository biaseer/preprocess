Speaking to the press on Wednesday, he said that the main category of study subjects was a group of male patients aged 40-60 with a high degree of physical exhaustion.
He assured that, according to the evidence found, Washington and Kiev used the city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region as a regional center for the collection and registration of the cholera pathogen during the studies carried out in Ukrainian bio-laboratories.
Kirillov reported earlier about tests with potentially dangerous biological preparations on patients of the regional clinical psychiatric hospital number Three, also in Kharkov territory.
According to the senior Russian official, Washington tried to conceal the participation of its experts in biological experiments on patients in that Ukrainian hospital and to do so those conducting biological research left the country for third party territories.
In January 2022, the foreigners who conducted the experiments were urgently evacuated and the equipment and medicines they used were taken to the western regions of Ukraine, he explained.
The head of the radiological, chemical and biological protection troops of the Russian Armed Forces, Igor Kirillov, assured that Moscow received new information revealing details of the Pentagons inhumane experiments on Ukrainian nationals in psychiatric hospital Number One in the town of Strelechie in the Kharkov region.
