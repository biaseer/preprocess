Russian intelligence considered the possibility that the West might aim to take control of the situation in Ukraine.
It condemned that the NATO member countries special services transfer foreign terrorist fighters to Ukraine. According to SVR, the US-controlled Al-Tanf base in Syria trained terrorists to fight in Donbass.
The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service also indicated that the Central Intelligence Agency CIA, and the Special Operations Command continue to train new combat units in the Middle East and Africa.
SVR assured that Poland has recently become a logistics center for weapons supplies and sending mercenaries to Ukraine.
The Russian intelligence service pointed out that -along with the US intelligence service- the logistics center in Poland is also guaranteed by representatives of the UK, Canada and other NATO member nations. The Western plotting entities provide Ukraine with information on plans and movement from Russian troops.
