NATO added it is ready to prop up Ukrainian economy with new aid packages in the case the border crisis escalates into war.
We are united in our resolve to protect the sovereignty, territorial integrity as well as economic and financial stability of Ukraine. The G7, together with international financial institutions and in particular the International Monetary Fund IMF through its 2020 Stand-by Arrangement, are providing significant financial support to Ukraine, the statement added.
Russia opposes NATOs expansion into Eastern Europe, considering it is a threat to its national security. So, Russia still has more than 100,000 soldiers near Ukraine border. Russia claims its troops deployed in its territory is legal and has a defensive character.
We are prepared to collectively impose economic and financial sanctions which will have massive and immediate consequences on the Russian economy, the bloc comprised of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States said in a statement.
