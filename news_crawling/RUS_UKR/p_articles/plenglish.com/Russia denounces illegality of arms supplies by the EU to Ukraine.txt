She noted that it is contradictory, however, because in accordance with these statutes, by supplying arms to Kiev, the EU is recognizing the DPR and LPR, so then the conflict ceases to be internal to Ukraine.
EU countries, in principle, should not supply weapons, including Russian ones to a State that uses, will use or intends to use them againt its own citizens in an internal conflict, the official wrote.
She expressed that by failing to comply with these commitments, these nations violate the principles of the EU Council Common Position of December 2008,which defines the rules for controlling the export of military technology and equipment.
She stated that the EU bloc does not recognize the change in the territorial borders of Ukraine, so it considers the territories of Donetsk DPR and Lugansk Peoples Republics as Ukrainian LPR, despite the prevailing political and administrative realities.
Zakharova pointed out that otherwise the EU member countries are violating fundamental principles of integration.
She recalled that this document on the rules of arms transfers states that member States must refuse an export license if there is a clear risk that the exported technology or military equipment could be used for internal repression.
Similarly, the text indicates that member states should refuse to export license for military technology or equipment that is likely to provoke or prolong armed conflict or exacerbate existing tensions or conflicts in the country of final destination.
