Previously, the Kremlin recognized the independence and sovereignty of both territories and signed treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with their respective leaders, which included the establishment of diplomatic relations and military aid.
Since the beginning of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, just over a month ago, Moscow has sent 8,500 tons of humanitarian aid to Ukrainians.
In his speech to inform about the start of the military operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that his goal is to protect the Donbass people from abuses and genocide by Kiev during the past eight years, plus demilitarization and denazification in Ukraine.
According to the statement, the new batch was sent on 37 vehicles, including food, medicine and other staples.
The Russian Defense Ministry assured the attacks were not targeted the Ukrainian population or cities, but the countrys military infrastructure.
On February 24, Russia began a military operation in Ukraine following authorities of the self-proclaimed Peoples Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk requested assistance to repel the increased aggression from Kyiv.
