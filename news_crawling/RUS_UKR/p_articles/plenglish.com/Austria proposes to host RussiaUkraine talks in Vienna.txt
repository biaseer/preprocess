Negotiations began between delegations from Russia and Ukraine in the Gomel region, in Belarus, on Monday.
The offer of Vienna as a place for possible negotiations is made without seeking friendship and with the aim of putting an end to the armed conflict, according to Nehammer.
According to information from the ORF television channel, the chancellor insisted that a ceasefire must be a condition to be able to sit down at the negotiating table.
