Mizintsev assured that the Ukrainians plan to take reporters to these places to show the results of the attacks allegedly carried out by Russian soldiers and immediately spread false information. He called on the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the International Committee of the Red Cross, among other international organizations, to influence Kiev to prevent this inhumane provocation.
According to the warning, these teams were organized to bomb Orthodox churches and temples on Easter night April 23 to 24 and subsequently accuse Russian soldiers of massacring believers during the religious holiday.
According to reliable information available to us, the Ukrainian regime, with the support from several Western countries, is putting the finishing touches on monstrous provocations with numerous victims in the regions of Zaporozhye, Nikolayev, Odessa, Sumy and Kharkov regions, the officer said.
The military high command pointed out that 70 mobile groups of nationalist battalions have been prepared to carry out these actions and will move in vans and off-road vehicles transporting wandering mortars.
The provocations that Ukrainian authorities are preparing demonstrate their total indifference to the fate of their own citizens, he said.
The head of Russias National Defense Control Center said that such actions disregard all norms of morality and international humanitarian law.
