He indicated that the US government continues to fill Ukraine with weapons and further emphasized that the primary goal of the Pentagon spokesman and his colleagues is to generate additional revenue for the military-industrial complex and clear its warehouses of obsolete weapons, and that under such a policy, it seems clear that the White House is not interested in a ceasefire in Ukraine.
John Kirby has lost the dignity of an American officer by lowering himself to the level of a grave insult. He should be ashamed of himself for tarnishing the honor of his uniform, the Russian ambassador said.
It is surprising that these provocations come from a former military man who knows the meaning of the word well, Antonov wrote on the Telegram channel of Russias embassy in the US.
During a briefing on Friday, Kirby questioned Moscows motives for the Russian military operation in Ukraine, saying that Kiev did not threaten anyone.
Kirby said Moscow is filing outlandish signals about Nazis in Ukraine, Outlandish signals that it is about actions by the United States against Russia or the West against Russia. He also called Russian official statements about the operations goals bullshit and ridiculous claims.
