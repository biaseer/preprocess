Contrary to their obligations under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Affairs and Consular Relations, Kiev authorities did not react to what was happening, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
Likewise, it was denounced that the Russian diplomats were also subjected to aggressive actions, threatened with physical violence and vehicles were set on fire.
To protect their lives and safety, the Russian leadership has decided to evacuate the personnel of Russian foreign missions in Ukraine, a measure that will be implemented in the very near future, the statement added.
The statement recalled that the Russian embassy in Kiev and general consulates in the Ukrainian cities of Odessa, Lvov and Kharkiv have been repeatedly attacked since 2014.
In the current circumstances, our first priority is to take care of Russian diplomats and employees of the Embassy and Consulates General, the Ministry said in a lengthy statement.
Provocations have been regularly conducted against the Russian Center for Science and Culture based in Kiev, harming its directors health and damaging the center.
