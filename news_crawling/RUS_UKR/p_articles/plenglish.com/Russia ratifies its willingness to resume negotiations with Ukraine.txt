The Russian deputy Foreign Minister said that the Kremlin is guided by the official reaction of the Kiev authorities, referring to the statements of the adviser to the head of the Ukrainian presidents office, Mikhail Podoliak, who said that his government will reject any agreement with Russia that envisages recognition of the new territorial realities.
Along with the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples Republics, the Russian Armed Forces put under their control a considerable number of settlements and territories in the southeast of Ukraine, since the beginning of the military operation three months ago tomorrow.
Speaking to the press, the senior official assured that it was not Moscows initiative to freeze the talks. We would be ready to resume them as soon as Ukraine takes a constructive stance and makes known at least its reaction to the Russian proposals, he said.
