The announcement on the withdrawal of part of the diplomatic staff and relatives made this Monday by London follows a similar one made by Washington over the weekend.
According to Washington, the Kremlin has sent more than 100,000 troops to the vicinity of the Ukrainian border, but the Russian government denies having plans to attack, saying its troops are moving within its own territory for purely defensive purposes.
The statement clarifies, however, that the British embassy in Kiev remains open and will continue to carry out its essential tasks.
The United Kingdom and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO accuse Russia of planning to invade Ukraine, whose government has applied for membership in the military bloc.
The Russian embassy in London called on the British government on Sunday to stop its provocative statements about the situation around Ukraine, and instead contribute real diplomatic efforts to European security.
