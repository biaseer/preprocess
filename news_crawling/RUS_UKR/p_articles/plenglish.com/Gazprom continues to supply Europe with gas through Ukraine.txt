On May 10, the Ukrainian GTS Operator proclaimed that from May 11 it would stop gas transit to Europe through Sokhranovka because it allegedly cannot exercise control over the Novopskov border compressor station in the Lugansk region, an area that is part of the military conflict between the two countries.
Similarly, Gazprom reported that Russian sanctions against several foreign energy companies prohibit it from using the Yamal-Europe pipeline to pump Russian gas through Poland.
In this regard, the Russian company pointed out that there were no reasons for this decision and considered wrong the proposal to transfer all transit volumes to the Sudzha gas distribution station, in the Kursk region, for considering it impossible from the technological point of view, according to the Russian flow scheme.
He pointed out that supply goes through Sudzha gas metering station, as the request made by the Ukrainian company to carry out pumping through Sokhranovka station was rejected by the Ukrainian authorities.
