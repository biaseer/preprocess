Miroshnik added that between 300 and 400 Ukrainian radical elements are blocked in Azot, while around 500 civilians who hid in anti-aircraft shelters remain held there.
He posted on his Telegram channel that the lives of the Ukrainian soldiers will be respected and they will be properly treated under international laws if they release the hostages, stop the resistance and completely surrender.
The head of Russias National Defense Management Center, Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev, denounced on Thursday that Ukrainian fighters forcibly kept hundreds of Severodonetsk residents in the underground facilities of the Azot plant.
