He reiterated that his country cannot remain indifferent to the fact that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is on Russias doorstep, the main reason for the proposals for legal security guarantees presented by Moscow.
He stated that the dates of the negotiations are important for his country and considered inadmissible delaying them, despite the fact that Russia has not issued any ultimatum, nor plans to do so, in this regard.
The Russian Foreign Minister stressed that if such a scenario materializes, which he described as fantastic, Moscow will find the answer.
The head of Russian diplomacy explained that Washington will be the main negotiator with which Moscow will deal with security guarantees.
Lavrov confirmed that the main round of negotiations between Russia and the United States on the issue will take place just after the New Year holidays, which in this country conclude on January 10th.
Lavrov said in an interview with the Soloviev Live YouTube channel that he cannot answer for the mad men who push Western countries in that direction, referring to those who try to incite the Baltics, Ukrainians and Poles in that manner.
