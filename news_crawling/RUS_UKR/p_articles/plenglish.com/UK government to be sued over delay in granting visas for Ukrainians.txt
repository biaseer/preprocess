Last week, the Government admitted problems in processing permits at the Home Office that have caused delays in notifying those with a visa.
As many of 59,000 Ukrainians who have not arrived yet are people who received visas but they have not been informed by immigration authorities, The Guardian noted.
According to the publication, the lawsuit against Home Secretary Priti Patel is being prepared by groups that advocate for the Ukrainian refugees rights.    After the beginning of the war conflict between Russia and Ukraine on February 24, the UK Government offered refuge to people who are fleeing the crisis, but unlike other European countries that opened their borders, the United Kingdom carefully reviews each application.
According to official figures, of 86,000 Ukrainians who have so far received visas, only 27,100 have arrived in British territory.
