According to Radev, calls for peace, for an early end of the confrontation, gradually fade away and are replaced by military rhetoric and calls for victory.
Earlier, the president said that the aim of the operation was to protect the population of Donbass from abuses and genocide by Kiev over the past eight years, as well as to demilitarize Ukraine.
There is a categorical no to the provision of military assistance to Ukraine, since that would mean a step to attract Bulgaria to that conflict, the president affirmed.
The president expressed that it is necessary to understand what the word victory means and if it means self-destruction and economic liquidation of Europe, then I do not think that our countries should move in this direction.
Bulgaria should be part of the effort to bring peace and put an end to the conflict, as prolonging it would be harmful in many ways, he added.
Last February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation in Ukraine in response to the request for help from the leaders of the Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples Republics.
Radev also expressed doubts about the need for a government delegation, headed by Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, to visit Kiev tomorrow, Thursday.
