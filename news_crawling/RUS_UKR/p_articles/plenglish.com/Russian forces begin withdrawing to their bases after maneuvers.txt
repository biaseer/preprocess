Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday via telephone that Washingtons propaganda campaign about an aggression against Ukraine on Russias part is pursuing provocative goals.
It was previously reported that troops from almost all military districts of Russia participated in the exercises.
Speeches by Western politicians, diplomats and the media about alleged Russian plans against Kiev have escalated over the past two months, actions that have been denounced by Moscow.
The return of Russian forces to their bases comes at a time of heightened tensions in the region over repeated accusations made by Western authorities and media about Russias likely invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian presidential spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, described this strategy as an empty and unfounded increase in tension and emphasized that Russia does not represent a threat to anyone, and warned about the possibility that provocations will take place as a means to prove said Russian attack.
Russian authorities have repeatedly denied such allegations and have assured that Russia has no intention of attacking Ukraine and, on the contrary, have pointed out that these speculations could provoke the escalation of the internal conflict in that country.
