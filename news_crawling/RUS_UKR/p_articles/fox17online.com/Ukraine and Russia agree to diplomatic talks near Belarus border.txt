Russia had announced hours earlier that it had a delegation already in Belarus, ready to speak with Ukrainian officials.
Because Belarus is a close ally of Russia, Ukraine had previously rejected the idea of meeting in Belarus and said meetings should take elsewhere.
Zelenskyy said he and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko agreed to meet with the Russians without preconditions.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations commented on the announcement on Sunday, on CNNs State of the Union.
The office of Ukraines president has confirmed that a delegation will meet with Russian officials.
Lukashenko has agreed to keep all planes, helicopters and missiles on the ground while the two countries meet in his country, Zelenskyys office said.
The announcement of the meeting came shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces put on high alert in response to what he called aggressive statements by leading NATO powers.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys office said diplomats will meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border and did not give a precise time for the meeting.
