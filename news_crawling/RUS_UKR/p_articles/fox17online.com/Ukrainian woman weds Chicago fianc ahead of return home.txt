CHICAGO AP  A Chicago woman plans to travel to her home country of Ukraine, within days of getting married this weekend.
Maria says she decided to return to Ukraine on the third day of the Russian invasion. She doesn't have military or medical training but says she hopes to find some way to help.
Maria and her fianc, David, were married Saturday before about 20 people, and she plans to board a flight to Poland on Monday and find a way to cross into Ukraine. Both asked that their full names not be published out of concern for Maria's parents who are in Ukraine.
