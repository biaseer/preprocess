The U.S. announced new sanctions against Russia on Wednesday for its invasion of Ukraine and the atrocities documented in the town of Bucha, where civilians have been found bound and murdered.
"This action cuts them off from the U.S. financial system and freezes any assets they hold in the United States," the White House said in a statement.
The sanctions are expected to wipe out the last 15 years of economic gains in Russia, according to the White House.
The U.S. says it has been joined by more than 30 allies and partners in sanctioning Russia since the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine.

The sanctions target Russian President Vladimir Putin's adult children and family members of his inner circle.
