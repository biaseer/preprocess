Russia denied that any aircraft were damaged in Tuesdays blasts  or that any attack took place. But satellite photos clearly showed at least seven fighter planes at the base had been blown up and others probably damaged.
Official Kyiv has kept mum about it, but unofficially the military acknowledges that it was a Ukrainian strike, Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said.
He said the Russians fired at the city of Marganets and a nearby village. Dozens of residential buildings, two schools and several administrative buildings were damaged.
In other developments, Russian forces shelled areas across Ukraine on Tuesday night into Wednesday, including the central region of Dnipro, where 13 people were killed, according to the regions governor, Valentyn Reznichenko.
A lack of running water in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slovyansk means that residents must fill bottles by hand at public pumps throughout the city.
It was a terrible night, Reznichenko said. Its very hard to take bodies from under debris. We are facing a cruel enemy who engages in daily terror against our cities and villages.
On Wednesday, foreign ministers of the Group of 7 industrialized democracies demanded that Russia immediately hand back full control of the plant to Ukraine. They said they are profoundly concerned about the risk of a nuclear accident with far-reaching consequences.
In Ukraines east, where fighting has raged for eight years, a Russian attack on the center of the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region killed seven, wounded six and damaged stores, homes and apartment buildings, setting off fires, Ukraines prosecutor general said on the messaging app Telegram. Bakhmut is a key target for Russian forces as they advance on regional hubs.
The explosions, which killed one person and wounded 14, sent tourists fleeing in panic as plumes of smoke rose over the coastline nearby. Video showed shattered windows and holes in the brickwork of some buildings.
If Ukrainian forces were, in fact, responsible for the blasts, it would be the first known major attack on a Russian military site on the Crimean peninsula, which the Kremlin seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russian warplanes have used Saki to strike areas in Ukraines south.
One tourist, Natalia Lipovaya, said that the earth was gone from under my feet after the powerful blasts. I was so scared, she said.
A Ukrainian parliament member, Oleksandr Zavitnevich, said the airfield was rendered unusable. He reported on Facebook that it housed fighter jets, tactical reconnaissance aircraft and military transport planes.
During the war, the Kremlin has reported numerous fires and explosions on Russian territory near the Ukrainian border, blaming some of them on Ukrainian strikes. Ukrainian authorities have mostly kept silent about the incidents, preferring to keep the world guessing.
Colin Kahl, U.S. undersecretary of Defense for policy, estimated Monday that Russian forces have sustained up to 80,000 casualties in the fighting. He did not break down the figure with an estimate of forces killed or provide a Ukrainian casualty count.
The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said that it couldnt independently determine what caused the explosions but noted that simultaneous blasts in two places at the base probably rule out an accidental fire but not sabotage or a missile attack.
Ukraine said Wednesday that nine Russian warplanes were destroyed in a deadly string of explosions at an air base in Crimea that appeared to be the result of a Ukrainian attack, which would represent a significant escalation in the war.
Tymophiy, 12, lost his mother and stepfather in a hail of Russian fire and is now in the care of relatives. His diary is a record of fury and grief.
Two residents of the village of Staryi Saltiv in the Kharkiv region in the northeast were killed Wednesday in Russian shelling, police reported.
In the countrys southeast, Moscows forces continued shelling the city of Nikopol across the Dnieper River from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power station, the biggest nuclear plant in Europe. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling it, stoking international fears of a catastrophe.
But Russian authorities on Wednesday sought to downplay the explosions, saying all hotels and beaches were unaffected on the peninsula, which is a popular tourist destination for many Russians.
Crimeas regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said about 250 residents were moved to temporary housing after dozens of apartment buildings were damaged.
The base is  about 125 miles from the closest Ukrainian position. Zhdanov suggested that Ukrainian forces could have struck it with Ukrainian or Western-supplied anti-ship missiles that have the necessary range.
Russias invasion of Ukraine has upended the operations of what was the worlds fourth-largest grain exporter, with global consequences.
Ukrainian officials stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for the explosions, while mocking Russias explanation that a careless smoker might have caused ammunition at the Saki air base to catch fire and blow up. Analysts also said that explanation doesnt make sense and that the Ukrainians could have used anti-ship missiles to strike the base.
Crimea holds huge strategic and symbolic significance for both sides. The Kremlins demand that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia has been one of its key conditions for ending the fighting, while Ukraine has vowed to drive the Russians from the peninsula and all other occupied territories.
Stealth operations and assistance from Ukrainian guerrilla forces pose a growing challenge to Russias grip on occupied areas in southeastern Ukraine.
Satellite photos dated Wednesday issued by Planet Labs showed wreckage in spots on the airfield where the companys photos a day earlier showed numerous warplanes.
But it added: The Kremlin has little incentive to accuse Ukraine of conducting strikes that caused the damage since such strikes would demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defense systems.
A Ukrainian presidential advisor, Oleksiy Arestovych, cryptically said that the blasts were either caused by Ukrainian-made long-range weapons or the work of Ukrainian guerrillas operating in Crimea.
Neither side has released much information about their own casualties. In his nightly video address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed nearly 43,000 Russian soldiers had been killed.
Sergey Milochinsky, a resident, recalled hearing a roar and seeing a mushroom cloud from his window. Everything began to fall around, collapse, he said.
