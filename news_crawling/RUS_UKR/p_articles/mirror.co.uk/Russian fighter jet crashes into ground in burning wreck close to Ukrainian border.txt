Kanamat Botashev, a retired major general in the Russian Air Force, was killed when his Su-25 ground attack aircraft was hit by a Stinger missile, according to the BBC Russia.
A Russian fighter jet has crashed in a burning wreck close to the Ukrainian border.
The cause of the crash was not immediately clear amid suspicions it could have been shot down and the crash site is some 32 miles from the Ukrainian border.
Another commander wrote: "Farewell, commander... There are few people on this planet who lived in the sky as much as you do. The sky takes the best, today it took you."
"Today Kanamat died! Popasnaya district, 8:25 ... The first call of the unguided aircraft missiles, the second - bombs ... Stinger at the exit from the attack, an explosion in the air and ... That's it," one of his former colleagues said on messaging platform Telegram.
The pilot safely ejected, according to Russian reports, which denied it was hit by Ukraine.
A video shows the burned wreckage of the fighter in Russia's Belgorod region which shares frontiers with the Luhansk, Kharkiv and Sumy regions of Ukraine.
A Su-25 crashed in the Belgorod region today during a planned training flight, said the Russian military statement.

An eyewitness saw two warplanes had been flying and then there was suddenly a column of smoke.
The Russian Western military district said the Su-25 was on a training flight rather than a combat mission and suggested a technical malfunction as a possible cause.
