A key defence plan published just 11 months ago could be overhauled following Russia s invasion of Ukraine, MPs were told tonight.
But critics have claimed it is already outdated after Vladimir Putin ordered Kremlin forces to assault Ukraine - sparking the first major land war in Europe in decades.
The Ministry of Defence s top civil servant David Williams was tackled over the Integrated Review when he appeared before Whitehall spending watchdog the Commons Public Accounts Committee yesterdayMON.
The long-awaited document, Global Britain in a Competitive Age, the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, was only revealed last March.
He said: I think the Integrated Review looks to me right but of course we will want to review the calibration, our understanding of that threat and what the right response will need to be in light of events in Ukraine.
The attack has renewed scrutiny of the Governments plan, which includes bolstering cyber capabilities and modernising equipment.
Some of that may be quite quick, but some of it will need a little passage of time really to understand the nature of any change in the security environment in which we are operating.
But Army troop numbers are being slashed from 82,000 to just 73,000 and dozens of main battle tanks are being scrapped - raising fears over how the UK could repel invaders or defend NATO territory.
