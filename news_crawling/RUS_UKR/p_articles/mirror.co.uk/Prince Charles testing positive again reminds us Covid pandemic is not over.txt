So Boris Johnson must explain why he unilaterally decided to bring forward the end of all Covid restrictions.
Everything must be done to prevent Russia from carrying out its threat to invade Ukraine.
It is also noticeable that neither the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Chris Whitty, nor the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, have said whether they approve of the PMs actions.
Forcing him to back down requires careful and well-calibrated diplomacy, not cavalier comments and photo opportunities designed to distract attention from domestic troubles.
But there is a fine line between taking a firm stance against Russian aggression and inflaming an already delicate situation.
Prince Charles has contracted Covid-19 for a second time. It is hoped he has not passed it on to the Queen. The Palace said she is not showing symptoms and she is expected to take daily tests
Boris Johnsons overblown rhetoric yesterday risked crossing that line. President Putin is deliberately testing the resolve of the West.
The fact he has contracted it a second time is a reminder the pandemic is far from over.
Vladimir Putin is playing a reckless and risky game by massing an estimated 130,000 Russian troops on the countrys border. The response from the West must be resolute and united.
One member of SAGE has said they were blindsided by the decision even though it has implications for millions of peoples health.
Tens of thousands are still coming down with the virus every day and, just as Charles will hope he has not passed it on to the Queen, they too will worry about spreading it.
People will rightly ask whether the Prime Minister is acting in the national interest or out of political expediency.
