Moments later the Russian BMP explodes before the crew of three inside move their cannon and target the ambushers.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that 10 humanitarian corridors have been agreed for the evacuation of people across the country, including for people to leave the southern besieged port of Mariupol by private transport.
Multiple attempts to agree safe passage for buses to take supplies to Mariupol and bring out civilians have failed, with each side blaming the other.
Another video from the scene shows the bodies of at least six Russian infantry troops.
Dramatic video footage shows the moment Ukrainian soldiers appeared to wipe out a Russian armoured personnel carrier in Mariupol.
The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that it transported more than 80 residents from the left bank district of Mariupol on Friday, the Russian RIA news agency reported.
The Ukrainian Azov Battalion filmed themselves and shared the video of the ambush of Russian forces with the caption: Azov in Mariupol continues to destroy the enemy
The Azov Battalion filmed themselves on a rooftop armed with a Russian-made RPO-A Shmel before they targeted a Russian BMP-2.
Mariupol, with its strategic location on the coast of the Sea of Azov, has been battered by Russian strikes since the start of the war on February 24.
Moscow has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a "special military operation" aimed at demilitarising and "denazifying" its neighbour.
In the footage, a fighter takes aim and fires his RPO-A Shmel, a rocket launcher, at the Russians in a few seconds.
The Battalion shared the ambush video with the caption: Azov in Mariupol continues to destroy the enemy.
