Mr Cameron, who has faced years of criticism for his austerity programme that left more Brits relying on food banks, made sure to pose for a number of photos for Twitter.
"I'm currently driving to Poland with two Chippy Larder colleagues to make our delivery to the Red Cross.
Former Prime Minister David Cameron is driving a lorry to Poland with food and first aid kits for Ukrainian refugees.
The ex-PM said he should have "ripped the plaster off" earlier in his premiership and introduced steeper cuts in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
The former PM boasted that he has been volunteering at the food project which helps low income families for the last two years every week.
"In the last fortnight we've appealed for the things that refuges from Ukraine need as they arrive in Poland," he said on Twitter.
Mr Cameron, who has faced years of criticism for his austerity programme that left more Brits relying on food banks, has posted a number of shots on social media in his lorry, and in front of vegetables.
The Chippy Larder has described itself as a low cost community food larder to Chipping Norton promises to give people food that would normally cost 20 for 3.50.
It comes as Ukrainian MPs told the Mirror humanitarian agencies are struggling to operate in Ukraine because Russian troops are blocking corridors.
"Its going to be a long drive, but Ill keep you updated along the way. StandWithUkraine."
Four Ukrainian MPs who came to the House of Commons on Thursday even accused Vladimir Putin's troops of raping and hanging women over 60.
In his memoirs which were serialised by The Times, Mr Cameron said he didn't cut public spending enough.
