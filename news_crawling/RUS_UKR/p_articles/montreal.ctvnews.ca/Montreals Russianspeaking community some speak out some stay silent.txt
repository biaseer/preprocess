Some people are still trying desperately to not justify the decision of Russia, but at least say this is our country and we as Russians dont want to be ashamed of being Russian, said Zamkova.
Zamkova is heading to Hungary to help Ukrainian refugees but worries Russias brutal invasion is having a ripple effect here, too.
People are looking to vent their anger around them and target so-called Russian businesses, but businesses have nothing in common with Russian regime, most belong to Ukraine, Moldova, other countries, Korobkov said.

Oleg Maximoff is one of the organizers of Saturdays protest outside the Russian consulate in Montreal.
