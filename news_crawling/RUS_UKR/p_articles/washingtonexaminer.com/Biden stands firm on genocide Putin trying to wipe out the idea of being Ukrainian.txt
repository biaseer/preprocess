Biden just last week had been reticent to use the word "genocide" despite publicly supporting a war crimes trial against Putin.
President Joe Biden is standing by his statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin is committing genocide in Ukraine.
True words of a true leader POTUS. Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil. We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.
Putin's withdrawal of Russian forces from around Kyiv, focusing instead on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, has uncovered evidence of civilian mass graves and the torture of captives.
"We're going to only learn more and more about the devastation," he added. "Well let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me."
Its become clearer and clearer that Putin is trying to wipe out the idea of being Ukrainian," Biden said in Iowa.
"The evidence is mounting. It looks different than last week," he said Tuesday. "More evidence is coming out literally of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine."
"True words of a true leader," he tweeted. "Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil. We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities."
"Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank  none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away," he had said.
