CIA Director William Burns delivered a speech on Thursday in which he said the military struggles Russian President Vladimir Putin has faced in his attack in Ukraine could lead him to act rashly.
"We're obviously very concerned, Burns said.  I know President Biden is deeply concerned about avoiding a third world war, about avoiding a threshold in which, you know, nuclear conflict becomes possible.
Putin placed Russias nuclear forces on high alert days after invading Ukraine a little more than seven weeks ago. Since then, Kremlin officials have said that an existential threat to the country could force Russias hand to deploy its nuclear arsenal.
"Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they've faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons," Burns said.
Earlier this week, Russia escalated its nuclear posturing, threatening the prospect of nuclear-armed ships in the Baltic Sea if Finland and Sweden join NATO.
Burns said the United States has not seen a lot of practical evidence that Russia is going to use any kind of nuclear weapon but that leaders are still wary and concerned about nuclear escalation.
