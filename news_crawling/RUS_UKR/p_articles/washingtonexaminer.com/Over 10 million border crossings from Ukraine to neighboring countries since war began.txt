The agency warned, as it often does in its daily updates, that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.
More than 10 million people have crossed from Ukrainian territory into a neighboring country in the months since Russia invaded.
Poland has accepted just about half of all Ukrainian refugees, 5.1 million people. Following them, just shy of 2 million people crossed from Ukraine into Russia, while another million-plus have entered Hungary. No other country has accepted a million or more Ukrainian refugees, but Romania is at roughly 965,000, Germany is at 915,000, Slovakia is just shy of 650,000, and the Czech Republic is at 400,000.
As of Aug. 1, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that there have been more than 12,500 civilian casualties, including more than 5,327 of whom were killed.
There have been 10,321,348 crossings since the war began, according to the latest data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Nearly 6.3 million of them have been recorded across Europe, while another 3.7 million have registered for Temporary Projection or some similar national protection program.
