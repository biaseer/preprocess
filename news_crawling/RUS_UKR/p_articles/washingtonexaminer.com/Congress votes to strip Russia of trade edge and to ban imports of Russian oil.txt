The Senate voted unanimously Thursday to strip Russia of its preferred trading status and approved a bill banning Russian energy imports.
The goal of the bills, which passed 100-0 in the Senate, is to further an economic chokehold on Russia as it continues to assault Ukraine.
The future of the import ban bill was uncertain for a time as it didn't seem likely lawmakers could reach a deal before the deadline with the Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson taking priority.
The Senate approved the measures to demote Russia from a priority trading partner and embargo Russia's oil, natural gas, and coal exports. The House approved the first bill with only three members voting against it and nine against the second. The bills head to President Joe Biden's desk, where he is expected to sign them as they codify into law an executive order he issued last month.
Ending permanent, normal trade with Russia is a largely symbolic move that can open the path to increasing tariffs on Russian imports. The second bill involved a flurry of negotiation under increasing pressure as the violence in Ukraine worsens and Congress faces a Friday deadline before the two-week Easter recess.
"Putin must absolutely be held accountable for the detestable, despicable war crimes he is committing against Ukraine: The images we have seen coming out of that country, especially out of the town of Bucha, are just pure evil," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday.
