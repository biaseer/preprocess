The US and its NATO allies are accusing Russia of planning a new invasion on Ukraine after it annexed the Crimea in 2014, which Russia denies. The US estimates there are around 130,000 Russian troops along the border with Ukraine, and US intelligence agencies say Russia could shortly invade its neighbour.
Calls for de-escalation and expressions of concern are coming in from a number of Western countries and their allies, with G7 finance ministers saying on Monday they were willing to impose massive economic and financial sanctions on Russia, should it attack Ukraine.
Jana spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmygal over the phone on Saturday, telling him that Slovenia was monitoring with concern the build-up of the Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
Jana expressed support for Ukraines territorial integrity and the right of every country to choose its alliance and urged immediate de-escalation of the situation.
As Michel said on Twitter, the conference was also attended by the prime ministers of Greece, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands and Slovakia, after he discussed the situation with the prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Sweden, Bulgaria, Lithuania and the Czech Republic on Sunday.
Ljubljana  PM Janez Jana joined European Council President Charles Michel and several EU counterparts via videocall on Monday to discuss the tense security situation in Eastern Europe, assistance to Ukraine and consequences of a potential Russian invasion. Michel stressed the EUs unity, solidarity and firmness regarding the situation in Ukraine.
