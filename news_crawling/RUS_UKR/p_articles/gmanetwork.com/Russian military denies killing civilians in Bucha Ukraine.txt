The ministry said all residents "had the opportunity to freely leave the settlement in the northern direction," while the southern suburbs of the city "were fired at around the clock by Ukrainian troops."
"During the time this settlement was under the control of Russian armed forces, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions," the ministry said in a statement, saying Russia's military delivered 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid to civilians there.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called the killings "genocide," amid the discovery of mass graves in the town.
The ministry said that all Russian units withdrew from Bucha on March 30, a day after Russia's military announced it would be significantly reducing activity in northern Ukraine. Agence France-Presse
Photo and video of corpses strewn across the streets of Bucha were "another production of the Kyiv regime for the Western media," it claimed.
