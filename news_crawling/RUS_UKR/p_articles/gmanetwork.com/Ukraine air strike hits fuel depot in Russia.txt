Ukrainian helicopters have carried out a strike on a fuel storage facility in Russia's western town of Belgorod, the local governor said on Friday.

On Wednesday, explosions could be heard from an arms depot in Belgorod but the authorities did not provide any explanation for the blasts.
Two employees at the storage facilities were injured as a result of the fire, he said in another post.
Rosneft, which owns the facility, told Russian news agencies that it had evacuated staff from the premises.
"There was a fire at the petrol depot because of an air strike carried out by two Ukrainian army helicopters, who entered Russian territory at a low altitude," Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on his Telegram channel.
Some 170 personnel were trying to put out the blaze, according to Russia's emergencies ministry.
