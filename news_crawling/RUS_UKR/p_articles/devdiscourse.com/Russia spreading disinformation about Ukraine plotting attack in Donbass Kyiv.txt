The Kremlin earlier on Monday had expressed alarm about what it said was a U.S.-backed push to supply Ukraine with sophisticated weaponry, and accused Kyiv of having "aggressive dreams" in solving the Donbass conflict.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia on Monday of spreading disinformation, including that the Kyiv government was planning a military offensive in the eastern Donbass region.
