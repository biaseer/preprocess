"The most important thing you can do now for Ukraine is to read and disseminate verified information about what is happening," they said, attaching a list of "operative, truthful information" about Russia's war against Ukraine.
The letter, circulated to the media, was signed by Oleh Sentsov 'Rhino' Valentyn Vasyanovych 'Reflection' and 'Atlantis' Maryna Er Gorbach 'Klondike' Anna Machukh, executive director, Ukrainian Film Academy and Odessa International Film Festival OIFF Natalia Vorozhbyt, 'Bad Roads' Iryna Tsilyk 'The Earth is Blue as an Orange' and Nariman Aliev, 'Homeward'.
Vorozhbyt detailed her family's activities and wrote: "We took chairs, candles and water to the basement. I allowed my daughter to swear, because she was scared. My ex-husband enlisted in the army. We live in the centre of Europe, in the 21st century, in Ukraine. Our closest neighbours are Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Baltics, Romania. Near Germany, France, Italy, etc -- we can go there by car. This is not just our war."
