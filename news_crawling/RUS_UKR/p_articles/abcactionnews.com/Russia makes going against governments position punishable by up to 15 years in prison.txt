The law envisages sentences of up to three years or fines for spreading what authorities deem to be false news about the military, but the maximum punishment rises to 15 years for cases deemed to have led to severe consequences.
Also Friday, the state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, blocked Facebook and five foreign media organizations based abroad which publish news in Russian in a sweeping action to establish tight control over information about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill introducing a prison sentence of up to 15 years for spreading information that goes against the Russian governments position on the war in Ukraine.
Russian authorities have repeatedly decried reports of Russian military setbacks or civilian deaths in Ukraine as fake reports. State media outlets refer to Russias invasion of Ukraine as a special military operation rather than a war or invasion.
The bill criminalizing the intentional spreading of what Russia deems to be fake reports about the war was quickly rubber-stamped by both houses of the Kremlin-controlled parliament earlier Friday.
