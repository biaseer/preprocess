U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said this is a time for courage, not caution. Despite Truss call for jets, British Prime Minister Boris Johnsons spokesman said there were no plans for the U.K. to send planes to Ukraine.
NATO nations have supplied Ukraine with military supplies including missiles and armored vehicles. But so far they have been reluctant to send fighter planes for fear of escalating the conflict.
Truss also said Russias attack on Ukraine must be a wake-up call for international institutions. She called for a new focus on military strength, economic security and deeper global alliances.
LONDON  Britains top diplomat says Western allies should send tanks, planes and other heavy weapons to Ukraine, saying inaction would be the greatest provocation.
