An 18-year-old gamer based in California survived a stray bullet that came through his bedroom window thanks to his headset.
Remarkably the reason Gonzalez survived appears to be because the bullet in question ricocheted off his Razer Kraken gaming headset.
Speaking with CBS news Jonathan Gonzalez, 18, recalls playing PlayStation with his friends shortly after midnight when he felt something hit him on his head.
Lying in a trench, the soldier pulls the phone out of his pocket and turns it around to show the camera. A 7.62 caliber bullet is embedded in the back of the phone, where it was safely lodged and left the soldier unharmed.
Twitter users have identified the case in question as the S-View Flip Cover Case, an official Samsung phone case which can be bought on Amazon for 22.
A Ukrainian soldier's life was saved by his smartphone case after being shot during a skirmish with the Russians.

The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra costs around 750 in the UK, and was the company's flagship phone for some years.
It felt like if youre wearing a bike helmet and someone just smacks the top of your head, Gonzalez said in a TV interview.
War correspondent OSINTtechnical shared a video on Twitter of the anonymous Ukrainian soldier showing how his Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra stopped a bullet.
The soldier also had a dog tag in his pocket which helped stop the bullet, and he reportedly credits both the phone and the tag in saving his life.
However, he might need to buy a new phone as the one that saved him no longer appears to work.
