North Carolina is playing a growing role in the push for energy autonomy, from solar panels to new wind farms off the coast, as a recent report shows North Carolina has seen a 265-fold increase in the production of solar energy since 2011.
And as Russia invaded Ukraine, beginning a deadly, unprovoked war, much of the world looked to get their energy from countries besides Russia. Its proven complicated, though, as Russia produces one out of every ten barrels of oil in the world and Russia supplies about 40 of the European Union's natural gas imports.
From the electricity powering our homes to the gas fueling our cars, reliable energy sources are critical to a functioning society.
While experts disagree if America is already energy independent, it's an objective both Democrats and Republicans support. Still, despite the U.S. being the worlds biggest producer of oil and natural gas, prices and supplies still depend heavily on global market forces and events. One approach toward broader energy independence is in renewable energy, but that has largely been opposed by Republicans and some Democrats.
We sit down with energy experts to learn how North Carolina plays a role in the international effort to wean off dirty energy and maintain a renewable, independent energy system.
