GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN Reuters -     German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a summit of the Group of Seven rich democracies on Monday there would be no return to the times before Russia's attack on Ukraine, which had ushered in long-term changes in international relations.
"When the situation changes, we have to change," Scholz said in a televised statement at the end of the second day of the G7 summit taking place in a castle resort in the Bavarian Alps.

Scholz, who is hosting this year's gathering, said that the G7 leaders had held constructive discussions with the guest nations on Monday - India, Indonesia, Senegal, South Africa and Argentina - which he labeled "democracies of the future".
