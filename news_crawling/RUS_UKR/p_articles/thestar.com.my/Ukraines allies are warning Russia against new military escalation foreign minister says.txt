"This is a political track in which certain positions are communicated with Russia and the consequences for Russia are discussed if it resorts to a new wave of aggression against our state," Kuleba said.
The Kremlin earlier dismissed a media report which suggested the United States was worried that Moscow would launch an attack on Ukraine, saying Russia did not pose a threat to anyone.
