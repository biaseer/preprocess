The United States and NATO have ruled out sending their own forces to Ukraine, but Washington and its European allies have supplied large quantities of weapons to Kyiv, including drones and anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles.
Russia has warned the United States that large Western deliveries of weapons to Ukraine are fuelling the nine-week-old conflict.
Reuters -     Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday its Kalibr missiles had struck an arms depot in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region housing weapons from the United States and European countries.
It was not possible to independently confirm the Russian claim, which did not say which kinds of weapons were housed in the hangars.
The ministry -- which said its air force had destroyed 59 Ukrainian military targets overnight -- said the missiles had "destroyed hangars with a large batch of foreign weapons and ammunition supplied to Ukrainian troops by the United States and European countries."
