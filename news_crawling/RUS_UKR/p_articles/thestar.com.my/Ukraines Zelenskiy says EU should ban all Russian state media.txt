KYIV Reuters -     Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the European Union on Wednesday to ban all Russian state TV channels and "propagandists", an apparent reference to Russian state media employees.
"Not a single Russian propaganda-monger should stay on the territory of the EU. Not a single Russian state TV channel should be allowed to keep working on the territory of the EU," Zelenskiy said through a translator.
