Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian borders, sparkling fears of a planned assault. Moscow has said it is not planning an invasion but could take unspecified military action if its security demands are not met.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said a week ago Ukraine was not a sinking Titanic and accused Washington and media of fuelling panic that weighed on the economy when there were "no tanks in the streets".
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday Russia could take military action "any day now" but could still opt for diplomacy.
"Today, Ukraine has a strong army, unprecedented international support and Ukrainians' faith in their country," Kuleba said in a tweet.
"We must also be prepared for economic reactions and sanctions if there is a deterioration."
A day earlier two U.S. officials said that Russia may be ready for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by mid-February as it  had in place about 70 of the combat power it believed it would need and was sending more battalion tactical groups to the border.
Those include a promise that NATO will never admit Ukraine, a demand Washington and NATO have said is unacceptable.

KYIV Reuters -     Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Sunday urged people to ignore "apocalyptic predictions" about an imminent Russian invasion, saying his country was strong and had unprecedented international support.
"We must help the NATO countries bordering Russia and strengthen them also from a military point of view," he said on Italian national broadcaster RAI.
