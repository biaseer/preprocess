Dr Wee added that the price hike doesn't come suddenly but due to several factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic.
"While the issue does concern the government, we also hope the cooperative koperasi will assist in the matter such as selling the fertiliser in bulk," he said.
It was reported that oil palm planters were facing an operational cost hike of between 10 and 15 including fertilisers, labour and fuel.
The Deputy Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister said the ministry was holding several discussions on how to help oil palm smallholders.
"The price hike in fertiliser doesn't just affect the oil palm industry but also the whole agriculture sector.
"Oil palm smallholders play a big role in contributing to the economy. Although the price hike in fertiliser isn't under my ministry, we are having several discussions on how to help them," he said during the "One student, 10 trees" campaign at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman UTAR here on Wednesday March 30.
"With what is happening between Russia and Ukraine as well as China's policy to not export large amounts of raw materials, these events are among the factors that lead to the hike," he said, adding that there are nearly 500,000 oil palm smallholders in the country.
