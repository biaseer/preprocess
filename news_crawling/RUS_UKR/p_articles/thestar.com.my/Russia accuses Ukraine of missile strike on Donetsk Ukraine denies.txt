"It is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition, there's not even any point talking about it," Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin told a televised briefing.
Ukraine has denied suggestions it would try to recapture the eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, under the control of Russian-backed forces since 2014, by force.
The ministry provided no evidence and Ukraine denied launching such an attack. Reuters could not independently verify the statements by either side.
Reuters -     Russia's defence ministry said on Monday that 20 people had been killed and 28 wounded when a Ukrainian missile with a cluster charge exploded in the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.
Pro-Russian separatists who control part of Ukraine's Donetsk region said earlier that a child was among those hit in the alleged strike and they accused Kyiv of committing a war crime.
Ukraine and its allies have previously accused Russia of planning "false flag" operations to create pretexts for further military offensives against Ukraine.
