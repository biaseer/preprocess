Around two-thirds of North Carolinians think the United States should assist Ukraine with military weapons and ammunition. However, theres less support for direct involvement from the U.S, including a slim majority favoring a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and minority of about 1 in 3 who want U.S. troops committed to Ukraine.
A survey done by the Center for Survey Research at East Carolina University shows that most North Carolinians support U.S. sanctions against Russia. PREs Meredith Radford has more on the surveys findings.
Where the parties didnt agree were in questions that included President Joe Biden, where 35 of all North Carolinians approved of the overall job Biden is doing and 37 approved of his handling of the Ukraine conflict.
In this poll, there was unity across party lines in questions about the U.S. response to Russias invasion in Ukraine, and on economic questions including support of the ban on Russian oil as gas prices remain high.
Something else that stood out to Francia was the bipartisanship of the results. He says generally, when asking any questions that are political in nature, answers are tremendously different between Democrats and Republicans.
Political Science professor and Center for Survey Research director Peter Francia says that result was surprising, given whats at stake.
If the United States is sending troops into Ukraine, were talking about a real possibility of there being fighting with Russian soldiers. And if you have American soldiers fighting Russian soldiers, were talking about a major war.
