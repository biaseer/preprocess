On Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that it had hit a TV tower in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev a day earlier.
The strike, which was carried out with high-precision weapons, was aimed at thwarting "information attacks" by Ukraine and didn't affect any residential buildings, ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.
The Kiev authorities have claimed that at least five people were killed and as many injured in the attack.
Several videos purportedly filmed in the city captured thick black smoke billowing from the area around the tower after what appears to have been a missile strike, RT reported.
