It is also proposed to implement a series of provocations of a violent terrorist nature which will be "organized" by ethnic Ukrainians.
The plan includes giving protests related to the sharp deterioration of living conditions of Russians an ethnic "Ukrainian" colour.
New Delhi, March 13 : Russian special services are planning a special operation to discredit Ukrainians living in the Russian Federation.
As part of the special operation they are planning to disseminate appeals to Ukrainians living in Russia to lead a protest movement to overthrow the Putin regime. Leaders of public opinion outside Russia with a supposedly pro-Ukrainian position will be involved in the proclamation of the appeals, the report said.
Intensifying propaganda to explain to the citizens of the Russian Federation the inevitability of war with Ukraine and the need to exterminate Ukrainians is also part of the said plan, Ukraine has claimed.
The Centre for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said in order to consolidate Russian society in support of the war with Ukraine, Russian special services plan to conduct an operation aimed at discrediting Ukrainians living in Russia, Ukrayinska Pravda reported.
