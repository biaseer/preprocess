Responding to a photo of the woman in the aftermath of Wednesday's attack, the Embassy had tweeted: "She has some very realistic make-up. She is also doing well with her beauty blogs. Plus she could not be in the maternity house at the time of the strike, as it has long been taken by the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion who told all the staff to clear the place."
The Twitter account of the Embassy in London has been actively disseminating false information about ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine.
The Embassy has had at least three tweets removed within a day for violating the platform's rules, reports The Verge.
On Thursday, Twitter suspended asbmilitary, an account spreading the fake conspiracy theory that the US holds biological weapons labs in Ukraine.
