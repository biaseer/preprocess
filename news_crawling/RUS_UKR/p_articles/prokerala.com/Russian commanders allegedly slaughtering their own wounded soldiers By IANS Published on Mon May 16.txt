Asked by Zolkin what he meant, the captured Russian said: "Just like that... a wounded soldier is lying on the ground, and a battalion's commander shoots him dead with a gun."
It comes as investigations in the horror town of Bucha have revealed 650 civilians were shot rather than hit by shelling in what police say proves they were executed by Russian troops.
Captured troops recalled one commander asking a soldier if he could walk after suffering an injury, and when the man replied he could not, the officer killed him instantly.
He added: "It was a young man, he was wounded. He was on the ground. He was asked if he could walk. He was shot dead with a gun," Daily Mail reported.
A lieutenant-colonel was accused of personally shooting dead multiple troops as they lay injured, Daily Mail reported.
They are shown speaking in a video clip made by Ukrainian journalist Volodymyr Zolkin who has chronicled Russian captives for Open Media Ukraine.
