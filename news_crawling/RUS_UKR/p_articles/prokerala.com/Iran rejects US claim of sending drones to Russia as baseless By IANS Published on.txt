Tehran, July 16 : Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has rejected a recent US claim that Iran is providing Russia with drones for use in Ukraine as "baseless" and politically motivated.
Such allegations, which came just ahead of the ongoing US President Joe Biden's Middle East tour, are aimed at "achieving specific political goals and purposes," the top Iranian diplomat said.
Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks on Friday in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, according to a press release on the Foreign Ministry's website, after US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Monday that "information" indicates Iran is preparing to provide Russia with "up to several hundred" drones, including weapons-capable ones, Xinhua news agency reported.
"Just as we said at the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, we are opposed to war in Afghanistan, Yemen, Palestine and also Ukraine," Amir-Abdollahian told Kuleba.
