Some 45 million euros about $48.63 million of the funding is allocated for humanitarian projects in Ukraine, and 5 million euros about $5.4 million dollars to projects in neighbouring Moldova, which has taken in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the start of the conflict, Xinhua news agency reported.
