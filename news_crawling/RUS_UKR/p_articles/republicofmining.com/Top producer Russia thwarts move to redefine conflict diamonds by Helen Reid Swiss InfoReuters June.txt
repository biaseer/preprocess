The rift in the Kimberley Process KP, which certifies rough diamond exports, risks paralyzing the body which makes decisions by consensus. The letters, which have not been previously reported, show a dispute over a proposal by Ukraine, the European Union, Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States to discuss Russias invasion of Ukraine and whether to broaden the KPs definition of conflict diamonds to include state actors at its June 20-24 meeting in Botswana.
A draft agenda dated May 20 included an hour-long slot to discuss the issue, but the item was removed after objections from Russia, Belarus, Central African Republic CAR, Kyrgyzstan, and Mali.
The United States and Britain have already placed sanctions on Russias Alrosa, the worlds largest producer of rough diamonds, which accounted for around 30 of global output last year, and is partly state-owned.
JOHANNESBURG  Russia, supported by Belarus, Central African Republic, Kyrgyzstan and Mali, has torpedoed a Western-backed proposal to discuss whether its diamonds are funding war ahead of an international conflict diamond meeting in Botswana, letters seen by Reuters show.
