Russias invasion is the main reason behind the dramatic increase in price. Russia supplies around 10 per cent of the worlds nickel, and investors fear that Western sanctions against Russia could disrupt air and sea shipments of commodities produced and exported by Russia, Reuters reported Monday.
It was a wild day for nickel prices on Monday  reaching $US20 a pound briefly before retreating to $17.32  still an increase of a little more than $4 a pound compared to Friday.
Russias invasion, which has resulted in more than 1.7 million Ukrainians fleeing abroad, triggered sweeping sanctions by the Canada, the United States and Europe that aim to isolate Russia to a degree never before experienced by such a large economy.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a special operation. Bloomberg News said nickel surged to a record high in one of the most extreme price moves ever seen on the London Metal Exchange, as fears over Russian supplies leave buyers exposed to a historic squeeze.
