The US daring Russia to move into Ukraine. By the day war-mongering US warnings of immanent attack by Russia.
And that a small part of the 26 million Russians who died in World War II in their own country suffering the horrors of German genocidal destruction 1941 to 1945.
And who is arming all the forces in Ukraine whipping up more and more tension - the US and the UK of course.

A small number of 70,000 Russians who died in Germany in the final months of World War II defeating fascism.
All set up for a US led win win. And with that - war or no war - determination to move large scale NATO weapon systems into Ukraine. On Russias doorstep.
We want peace. Dont want to cast the world into another horrendous war we need to listen to the other side.
Currently a hundred thousand Ukrainian forces facing the pro Russian Dombas region in eastern Ukraine.
If Russia should move into eastern Ukraine, through provocation to defend Dombas region, then from the West told you so.
