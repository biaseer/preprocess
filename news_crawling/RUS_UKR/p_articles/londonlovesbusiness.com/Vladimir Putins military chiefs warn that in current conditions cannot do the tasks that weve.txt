Putin has reportedly been under pressure after reports emerged suggesting he has been misled by his military chief on the actual state of the invasion.
A defence expert has warned that Putin is facing a Julius Caesar scenario whether its physical death or simply being ousted in a coup by his closest allies.
His troops are retreating and are surrendering in their droves and they have been met with fierce resistance by Ukraine forces.
Exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky has said that Russias military top brass has warned Putin that they cannot do the tasks assigned.
Khodorkovsky told CNN, Of course, there are people that do have some influence on his mental perceptions, people such as Russian financier Yury Kovalchuk and those people who are aroundYury Kovalchuk.
Unless there is a Julius Caesar scenario, which awaits him at some point, and I do believe it awaits him at some point, in the meantime he may internationalise this crisis as his only way of surviving by being more repressing at home, more warlike abroad.
Putins future remains very uncertain as he has failed to deliver Ukraine and his reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed.
He warned that Putin could try to further expand the scope of his invasion in Ukraine in an attempt to secure support domestically and stamp out risks of a coup.
Putin has already withdrawn his forces from northern Ukraine amid the fierce resistance from the Ukrainian armed forces.
Vladimir Putins military is in tatters as they have warned that in current conditions cannot do the tasks that weve been assigned.
The military can tell Putin and they are telling him now that we, in current conditions cannot do the tasks that weve been assigned.
