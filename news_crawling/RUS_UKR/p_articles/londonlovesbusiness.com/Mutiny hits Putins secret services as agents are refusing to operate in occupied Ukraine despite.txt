Vladimir Putins secret services agents are refusing to work in occupied parts of Ukraine despite being offered eight times more pay.
FSB agents have resorted to filing medical complaints for them and their families which allows them to remain at home and not be posted to operate in peoples republics in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk, but also in Kherson, Zaporozhzhia and Kharkiv regions.
Independent media site We Can Explain said, The shortage of personnel in the special service is also confirmed by a draft decree submitted by the FSB itself.
The Kremlin are desperately trying to recruit FSB agents in order to instill Putins laws and rule in the Russian occupied areas.
This is a major blow for the Kremlin and Putin as they are failing to recruit the much needed counter intelligence officers in occupied areas.

This will allow the signing of contracts with recruits with only secondary education, not higher, as was required before, and with those who do not have experience of military service.
An FSB agent told Telegram there is little or no interest and added, We called 200 retired people and only three said they would think about it.
