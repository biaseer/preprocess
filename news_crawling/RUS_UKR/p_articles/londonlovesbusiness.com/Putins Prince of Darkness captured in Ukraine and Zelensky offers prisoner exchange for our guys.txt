Also, according to the President, it is symbolic that Medvedchuk was detained on Cosmonautics Day.
Well, if Medvedchuk chose a military uniform for himself, then he falls under wartime rules, Zelensky said.

He hid for 48 days. But, finally, he decided to run away outside our state. Well: the famous Lets go! didnt work for this astronaut in the bad sense of the word, Zelensky said.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has offered Russia to exchange former MP of the Opposition Platform  For Life party Medvedchuk for Ukrainian citizens who are held captive by the Russian military.
I propose to the Russian Federation to exchange this guy of yours Medvedchuk for our guys and girls who are now in Russian captivity, Zelensky said in a video message on Wednesday night.
Medvedchuk is also known as Ukraines grey cardinal and the prince of darkness and has been a key back door politician in the Ukraine, and in 2021 Forbes estimated his wealth to be $620m.
I think its especially cynical of him to use military camouflage. He tried to disguise himself like that. Such a warrior. Such a patriot.
Viktor Medvedchuk who is a close friend of Vladimir Putin and chose for the Russian President to be godfather to one of his daughters has been captured in Ukraine.
