This trend is particularly dangerous to Russian forces seeking to recruit still more new soldiers from Luhansk Oblast to make up for recent losses.
An American think tank, the Institute for the Study of War ISW said, Its message reflects a larger trend of diminished LNR investment in and morale to support the Russian war in Ukraine.
It added, Several volunteers who have already returned home from Ukraine stated that they felt deceived and treated worse than regular contract soldiers.
The Donbas is formed of Luhansk and Donetsk of Ukraine, with most parts being held by the Russian-backed LNR and DNR.
Putin has also been blasted on Tuesday by reports his soldiers are not being paid or being fed who are also being dumped in remote locations.
A report by the ISW found, Russian authorities have reportedly placed recruits with no experience into positions as commanding officers at the company level or higher.
Further division within Russian-led forces also threatens to further impede the efficiency of the Russian war effort.
DNR units have previously recorded similar appeals when operating in Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Kherson Oblasts, which may indicate that proxy troops might not fully support the Kremlins expansive invasion plans.
An online video shows Vladimir Putins soldiers from the Luhansk Peoples Republic LNR refusing to fight outside Luhansk including the neighbouring Donetsk Peoples Republic DNR.
They failed to provide sufficient food, ammunition, or cigarettes to soldiers, failed to provide for the funeral arrangements of volunteer soldiers killed in action.
