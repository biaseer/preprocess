Denisova said, In Kharkiv region, the enemy uses ammunition prohibited by international conventions. In Synelnikivsky district of Dnipropetrovsk region, a man who picked up a cluster munition blew up.
They have drawn attention that the use of such types of weapons of mass destruction against civilians is a crime against humanity, a war crime which does violate the Geneva Conventions of 1949.
Ammunition with a plastic case, small in size, weighing about one and a half kilogram, is scattered around the yards of residential buildings and streets, the commissioner for human rights said.
Russia have been accused of using banned weapons of mass destruction against Ukrainian civilians in the Kharkiv region.
Denisova warned that in addition Derhachi, Yemtsi and Bezruki, Kharkiv region, are especially dangerous areas as delayed-detonation mines have recently been found which explode within several hours, even if they were not blown up by hitting a target.
This is the fourth death in the region due to such shells. Several times, Russian occupiers fired cluster bombs at villages on the border of Donetsk and Kherson regions, the ombudsman said in Telegram channel on Monday.
She added, I appeal to the UN Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations during the Russian military invasion of Ukraine and the expert mission established by the OSCE participating states in accordance with the Moscow mechanism to take into account these facts of war crimes and violations of human rights by Russia in Ukraine.
Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Liudmyla Denisova has warned Russia are committing more war crimes as they are using ammunition prohibited by international conventions.
