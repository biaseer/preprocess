On Friday Putin said there had been certain positive shifts for peace talks but the Kremlin would not elaborate with any details.
However France has revealed some details of the call with Putin and the official warned that Putin does not appear ready to end the war in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said they have had concrete proposals with Russia instead of exchanging ultimatums.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 75-minute phone call with his counterparts with Germanys Olaf Sholz and the French President Emmanuel Macron to end the war in Ukraine.
