So there is still very much an ebb and flow in the fierce fighting thats taking place in eastern Ukraine right now.
Chance told CNN, Well, it doesnt look good for the Ukrainian forces because I can tell you theres a lot of fierce fighting taking place around the city of Severodonetsk, which is the biggest the last remaining city, really, that is under Ukrainian control in that region of eastern Ukraine.
If the Russians take control of it as looks likely at the moment, that would mean a big political win for them because it means theyve got full control over that Luhansk region, which is a significant step towards taking control of the whole Donbas region in the east of Ukraine.
Theyre seizing back territory thats been previously conquered by the Russians, killing Russian soldiers and destroying Russian military vehicles.
CNN Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance warned that the current situation on the ground doe not look good Ukrainian troops.
The Russian army are on the verge of a breakthrough in the Donbas region with the potential capture of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine which will be a big political win for Vladimir Putin.
There is fighting taking place elsewhere as well, in fact, as Russia concentrates its troops up there in the northeast of Ukraine, to the towards the south the Ukrainians say theyre making progress in a counter offence that theyve launched.
Ukrainian forces are being pushed out from their positions within the city of Severodonetsk and they are advancing along the Donbas front, which is the only remaining part of the Luhansk region left.
