BOSTON, Massachusetts: After the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicle RMV said it discovered approximately 2,100 drivers were granted drivers licenses without having to take a road test, it fired two test examiners and two service center employees.Beginning April 2018, some 2,100 applicants were given passing scores by two road test examiners at the Brockton Service Center without taking the road test, according to an internal investigation.The Massachusetts Department of Transportation said it first noticed suspicious activity in 2020 and launched a probe, enlisting the help of Massachusetts law enforcement."The RMV has terminated four employees involved in this matter and will continue to work with law enforcement on their ongoing investigation," said Department of Transportation spokesperson Jacquelyn Goddard.According to Registry of Motor Vehicle records, letters have been sent to state residents who did not complete the road test."All of the impacted individuals have been contacted and will be required to take and pass a road test within 10 days," Goddard added.Since discovering the incident, new preventative measures have been established, including instituting additional controls in the system used for license transactions, MassDOT said.
