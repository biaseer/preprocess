Downing Street has announced that Boris Johnson will give an announcement today regarding the ongoing Russian conflict in Ukraine.
The Prime Minister will be joined by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as well as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a joint press conference.
The UK has faced criticism for refusing to open its borders to Ukrainians but Johnson has insisted the country would welcome those fleeing the fighting, with thousands of visa applications being processed.
Johnson today warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was doubling down on his attacks against Ukraine, and his unrestrained anger must be met with tougher sanctions.
