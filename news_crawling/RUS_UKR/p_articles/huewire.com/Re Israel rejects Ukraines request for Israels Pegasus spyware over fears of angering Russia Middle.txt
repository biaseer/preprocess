Nobody wants to give Ukraine the S300 or the S400, afraid of Russia, but I bet Iran is willing to sell Ukraine the Bavar373. According to Iran it is better than the American Patriot or the Russian S300 and is most comparable to the S400. Do not listen to the sceptics who do not want to share their tech nor do they trust on it above the skies of Iran. I know that the USA wont give you the Abrams nor will Israel give you the Merkava but Iran most likely will sell Ukraine the Karrar T90. And do not forget to ask Iran for its little robots, that drive under tanks and do their thing. Iran went through the same as Ukraine, even worse than Ukraine, Ukraine has at least the support of the west like Saddam Hoessein, Iran is the last country to deny anybody weapons, Iran will never give up its weapons Ukraine and Iran will never expect another country to dit without an army.
