The Blonde Bombshell in Denison already doesn't serve Russian liquor, and co-owner Aaron Overturf says they never will.
"We decided that we are going to take off the Russian products off the shelves so that we are in support of our country with the rest of the world andpressurizingthe Putin regime," said owner Manny Khinda.
"We want to do what we can to help with the war we have right now," he said. "Even if it's on a small scale, you know, I think every bit helps."
"The good thing is, even our distributors, they're aware of this too," Khinda said. "All we have to tell them is that we don't want any of those."
"We just want to show Russia that we are in support of Ukraine we all are," said Raj Wagle at Reggis Liquor in Sherman. "The world is for peace and prosperity, not for war."
KTEN  As the conflict in Ukraine escalates, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is encouraging Lone Star State businesses to rid their shelves of Russian products.
"Not just businesses, but individuals not purchasing," said Blonde Bombshell co-owner Jonathan Earnhart. "Make sure that you are standing up to anyone who is funding this war and stop it."
"Since the issue came, we definitely started discussing at the corporate level whether to remove from the sell, or when we sell out to stop buying these products," Wagle said.
