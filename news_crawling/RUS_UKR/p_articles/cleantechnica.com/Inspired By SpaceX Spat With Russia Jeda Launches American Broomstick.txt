The 50-inch broomstick is also inspired by the SpaceX Falcon 9s second-stage separation. The brooms head is detachable. The stick is made from aluminum and American Broomstick is painted on in the NASA font. Its also made in the USA.

I asked the team at Jeda what inspired them to make their American Broomstick. They told me that it was their way of honoring SpaceX and NASA while helping those in need in Ukraine.
The American Broomstick is a medium-sized broomstick that is made up of two pieces with a reusable stave. The custom handle is modeled after the SpaceX Dragon Capsul. It is the worlds first SpaceX-inspired broomstick.
Solar power from space is closer to reality after Caltech sent a prototype system into orbit on January 3 to test the technology.
In the past Elon Musk has launched some satirical products that addressed issues, take the short shorts, for example. With the backhanded broomstick comments, we wanted to do the same. This was our way of honoring SpaceX and NASA, while also helping those in need in Ukraine and neighboring countries.
SpaceX successfully launched 47 Starlink satellites to orbit yesterday. Later on, Elon Musk shared a screenshot of a Reuters article. In that screenshot, Russias Head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, said in an interview on the Rossiya-24 TV network that Russia will no longer supply the US with its rocket engines and that the US can fly on something else, like broomsticks or whatever. Never mind that Russias technology is outdated in comparison with SpaceXs and that SpaceX is an American company.
Jeda, which sells aftermarket accessories for the Tesla Model 3 and Y, reached out to me to share the news about its launch of the SpaceX-inspired American Broomstick. But first, a short bit of background.
