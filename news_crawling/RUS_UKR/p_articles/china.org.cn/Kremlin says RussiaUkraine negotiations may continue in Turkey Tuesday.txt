Peskov noted that while face-to-face negotiations are more focused, and both sides can cover more issues, there are still no clear signs of a breakthrough.
Meanwhile, David Arakhamia, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, told Interfax-Ukraine news agency on Monday that the next round of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia will start on Tuesday in Turkey.
"Today, the delegation is leaving for Turkey... we expect that theoretically, talks could continue tomorrow," he said, adding that the negotiations would unlikely resume today.
