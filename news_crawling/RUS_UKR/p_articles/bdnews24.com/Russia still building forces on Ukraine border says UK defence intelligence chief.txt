"We have not seen evidence that Russia has withdrawn forces from Ukraines borders," Jim Hockenhull, the defence intelligence chief, said in a rare public statement.
"Contrary to their claims, Russia continues to build up military capabilities near Ukraine," he said. "This includes sightings of additional armoured vehicles, helicopters and a field hospital moving towards Ukraines borders. Russia has the military mass in place to conduct an invasion of Ukraine."
