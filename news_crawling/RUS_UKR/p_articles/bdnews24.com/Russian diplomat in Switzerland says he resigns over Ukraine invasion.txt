"I studied to be a diplomat and have been a diplomat for twenty years," Bondarev wrote. "The Russian foreign ministry has become my home and family. But I simply cannot any longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy."
The West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia and provided Ukraine with military support in response.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.
Ukraine had urged Russian diplomats to resign in a Human Rights Council debate in March. However, Bondarev said he did not expect others to follow. "I'm afraid I am the only one."
Boris Bondarev, a who identified himself on LinkedIn as a counsellor at Russia's permanent mission to the UN who worked on arms control, told Reuters: "I went to the mission like any other Monday morning and I forwarded my resignation letter and I walked out."
"It seems that there is only one honest person at the foreign ministry," she wrote on Twitter.
"I started to imagine this a few years ago but the scale of this disaster drove me to do it," he said, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb 24.
He said he had raised his concerns about the invasion with senior embassy staff several times. "I was told to keep my mouth shut in order to avoid ramifications," he said.
