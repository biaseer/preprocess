In an excerpt of the same interview aired on Saturday, Putinboasted that Russian anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainianweapons and are "cracking them like nuts."
Ukraine has been seeking Multiple Rocket Launch SystemsMLRS such as the M270 and M142 HIMARS to strike troops and weapons stockpilesat the Russian forces' rear.
US President Joe Biden announced plans this week to giveUkraine precision HIMARS rocket systems after receiving assurances from Kyivthat it would not use them to hit targets inside Russia.
Although Russian officials have warned that the US decisionto supply Ukraine with advanced rocket systems could exacerbate the conflict,Putin said it would not bring on any fundamental changes on the battlefield.
Putin did not name the targets Russia planned to pursue ifWestern countries began supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles. He saidthe "fuss" around Western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed todrag out the conflict.
If such missiles are supplied, "we will strike at thosetargets which we have not yet been hitting," Putin was quoted as saying inan excerpt of an interview with Rossiya-1 state television channel.
"We understand that this supply of advance rocketsystems from the United States and some other countries is meant to make upfor the losses of this military equipment," Putin said.
