Several aid agencies have raised concern about the Ukraine war diverting funds from other crises.
Six West African countries import 30-50 of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
"With the unfolding conflict in Ukraine, ports and suppliers are no longer accessible with shipments from the wider Black Sea delayed or simply cancelled," WFP Regional Director Chris Nikoi said in a statement.
Acute hunger has quadrupled in West Africa over the past three years, with 43 million people expected to face acute food insecurity by June 2022, according to the WFP.
The WFP was already struggling to expand its response to an "unprecedented food and nutrition crisis" in West Africa, and was forced to cut rations in seven countries because of lack of funding even before Russia's Feb 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The additional costs will hamper attempts to relieve a spiralling food crisis in the region fuelled by conflict, drought, pandemic-linked border closures and the impact of Ukraine's crisis on food prices and availability. read more
