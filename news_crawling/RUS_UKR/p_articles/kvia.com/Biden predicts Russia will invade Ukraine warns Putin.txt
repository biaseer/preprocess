WASHINGTON AP  President Joe Biden says he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine and is warning President Vladimir Putin that his country would pay a dear price in lives lost and a possible cutoff from the global banking system if it does. Biden also said a minor incursion by Russia would elicit a lesser response. He later sought to clarify that he was referring to a non-military action, such as a cyberattack, that would be met with a similar reciprocal response, and that if Russian forces cross the Ukrainian border, that changes everything. He was speaking at a news conference to mark his one-year anniversary in office.
