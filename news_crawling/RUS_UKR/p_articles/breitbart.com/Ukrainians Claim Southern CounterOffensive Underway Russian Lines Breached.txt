The first line of Russian defences on the Kherson front has been breached, claimed Sergey Khlan, an aide to Kyivs largely nominal governor of Kherson, in a Telegram post.
Vladimir Leontiev, the Kremlin-backed governor ofNova Kharkova, the second-largest city in the Kherson region, has advised residents that an evacuation will be carried out, however.
Russia found early success in southern Ukraine shortly after their invasion commenced, with forces striking northward from the Crimea, annexed in 2014, capturing swathes of territory even as a lightning strike for Kyiv  claimed to have been a mere feint by the Russians  appeared to end in failure.
Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region, saidUkrainian southern operational command spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk in comments quoted by The Telegraph.
As the invaders and pro-Russian separatists shifted their focus towards a grinding advance in the eastern Donbas region, however, the Ukrainians threatened a counter-offensive to recapture the occupied south, in recent weeks focusing their efforts on disabling bridges across theDnieper river in order to cut off Russian forces on its west bank.
Ukrainian officials claim that a long-awaited counter-offensive in the southern Kherson region is underway, and that the Russians first line of defence has been breached.
This is the announcement of what we have been waiting for since the spring  it is the beginning of the de-occupation of Kherson region.
Russian officials, for their part, have denied the counter-offensive is taking place  at least in the form described by the Ukrainians  and dismissed it as another Ukrainian propaganda fake.
