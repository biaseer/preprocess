Holt asked Zelensky if he understood President Joe Bidens hesitancy to escalate tension with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his invasion of Ukraine.
In an interview with NBC News Lester Holt, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested World War III may have already started.
He added, Nobody would be able to predict when the full-scale war would start and how it will end and how Putin ends to that. In any case, the war tends to end up in millions of people lost, people die, millions of buildings destroyed. Now we have different technologies, nuclear weapons in this case, we have the whole civilization at stake.
Zelensky went on to say that should Russia overtake Kyiv, the Ukrainian people are unconquerable.
Zelensky said that nobody knows whether it may have already started. He further warned that the whole civilization of Ukraine was at stake.
Well, nobody knows whether it may have already started and what is the possibility of this war if Ukraine will fall, in case Ukraine will fall, Zelensky told Holt through a translator on Wednesday. Its very hard to say, and weve seen this 80 years ago when the Second World War had started, and there were similar tragedies in history.
