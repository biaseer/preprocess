"All the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness. Because of your disunity," Zelensky railed at NATO https:t.co6QYys1ae0l
Zelensky said Saturday he told Israels Prime Minister Naftali Bennett that he would be ready to meet Putin in Jerusalem. Bennett visited Moscow for a meeting with Putin and spoke repeatedly with Zelensky and the leaders of France and Germany as he sought to help mediate an end to the war.
Speaking at a news conference, Zelensky said the Russians could take the Ukrainian capital only if they kill us all.
If that is their goal, let them come, he said. If they carry out carpet bombings and wipe off the historic memory of the entire region, the history of Kyivan Rus, the history of Europe, they could enter Kyiv, but they will have to live on that land alone, certainly without us.
