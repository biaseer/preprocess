Francis went on to specify the truce must not be a mere pause in fighting but a true negotiation for a lasting peace, one in which some sacrifice may be necessary for the good of the people.
In fact, what victory is there in planting a flag on a pile of rubble? he concluded.
The truce is not to provide more weapons and pick up the combat again  no!  a truce that will lead to peace, through real negotiation that is even disposed to some sacrifice for the good of the people, he said.

It is unclear exactly what sacrifice the pope has in mind, but his proposal inevitably would mean relinquishing a portion of Ukraine to the Russian invaders, something Ukraine has understandably been reluctant to do.
ROME  Pope Francis called for an Easter Truce in Russias war on Ukraine Sunday, urging compromise for the sake of peace.
Nothing is impossible for God, the pontiff told pilgrims gathered in Saint Peters Square for his weekly Angelus message. He can even bring an end to a war whose end is not in sight, a war that daily places before our eyes heinous massacres and atrocious cruelty committed against defenseless civilians.
Thus far, the Ukrainian military has proven remarkably resilient in resisting the Russian aggression, testimony to the motivation of defending ones homeland.
