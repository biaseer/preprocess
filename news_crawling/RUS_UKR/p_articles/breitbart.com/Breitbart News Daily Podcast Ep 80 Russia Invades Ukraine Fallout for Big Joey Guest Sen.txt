Russias invasion of Ukraine is underway, and the establishment media is feeding us sobering images of missiles, helicopters, tanks, and troops heading west toward Ukraines major urban areas where they will seemingly strangle the country into submission. But what will the U.S. response be? What about NATOs? The UNs? Is Taiwan next? Is this a new world order? Is the establishment media culpable? Breitbarts Jerome Hudson explains howwe got here. Our first guest is Sen. Marsha Blackburn R-TN, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who offers her take on the initial war moves by Russia. Our second guest is Ivan Andarza of Hispanic Republicans of Texas, who gives a status report on the political and election news in Texas and what November could look like from the Hispanic communitys standpoint.
The Breitbart News Daily Podcast runs Monday through Friday as a Directors Cut of the SXM Patriot radio show. Hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, youll hear Alexs take on the big political stories, interviews with various newsmakers, and the Patriot Caller of the Day.
