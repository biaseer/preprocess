To this effect, HWPL's Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War is recommended as a document that can guide and serve as a foundation to address the alternatives for resolving conflicts and tensions in that part of the world.

A never again to war should be the will that prevails to overcome the contradictions and divisions at a time of threats between the United States and Russia in a dispute for control in Ukraine to make political and economic interests prevail in the solution of the conflict.

The negotiations between Russia and Ukraine must be based on agreements that respect human rights and international humanitarian law based on the 1949 Geneva Convention to prevent the occurrence of crimes of international concern such as war crimes and aggression, which would require the intervention of international criminal courts, such as the International Criminal Court.
The situation of tension that exists on the border between Ukraine and Russia requires an exercise of dialogue and negotiation between the parties so that peace prevails in that part of the world. The no to war and the yes to peace is the great hope of the international community at this time.
Peace negotiation and dialogue in Ukraine implies an effective exercise of political diplomacy for the resolution of tensions between Ukraine and Russia, so that the situation of tension and conflict can be overcome to bring about the tranquility of the countries that have expressed interests in contributing to peace as a solution for the parties.
