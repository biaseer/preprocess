Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports have it that Vladimir Putin has also given green light for a ceasefire in Ukraine.
The UNSC on Sunday gave a green signal for an emergency meeting in Ukraine that will happen for the first time in decades. The meeting will give the opportunity to the members of the UN to speak about war and vote on a resolution later in the week.
In struggles to get millions of Ukrainians free from the adverse effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council are holding two different meetings on Monday, February 28.
The resolution that is aimed at deploying Russia's invasion of Ukraine was not unanimously voted by the 15-member Security Council with Russian opposing and China, India, and the UAE abstaining.
The meetings come as the Ukraine presidential office has confirmed speaking with Russia in a third country but denied Israel having been chosen as a mediator for the peace talks.
