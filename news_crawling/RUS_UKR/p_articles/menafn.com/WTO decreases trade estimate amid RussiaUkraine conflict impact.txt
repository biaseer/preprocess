WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala declared that the war has damaged the worldwide economy, and its effect is touched mainly in low-income nations where food is considered a huge proportion of household expenditure.
WTO declared that "The most immediate economic impact of the crisis has been a sharp rise in commodity prices. Despite their small shares in world trade and output, Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers of essential goods including food, energy, and fertilizers, supplies of which are now threatened by the war."

Restricting trade will threaten the wellbeing of families and businesses and make more fraught the task of building a durable economic recovery from COVID 19."MENAFN13042022000045012476ID1104008276

MENAFN The World Trade Organization WTO decreased its worldwide trade estimate for this year after Russia's attack on Ukraine and increasing commodity costs.
The WTO estimates that the worldwide economy is going to grow by 2.8 percent this year, decreasing from the earlier estimate of 4.1 percent, after increasing 5.7 percent 2021.
WTO states that although worldwide economy is estimate to expand 3.2 percent next year, international trade figure is estimated to grow 3.4 percent in 2023, while also stating that those forecasts could be reviewed because of the doubt on the conflict.
"The war is not the only factor weighing on world trade at the moment. Lockdowns in China to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are again disrupting seaborne trade at a time when supply chain pressures appeared to be easing. This could lead to renewed shortages of manufacturing inputs and higher inflation," WTO also stated.
