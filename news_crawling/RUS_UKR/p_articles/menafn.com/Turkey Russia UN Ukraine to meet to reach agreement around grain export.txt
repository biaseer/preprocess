Erdogan stated at a mass opening ceremony in Istanbul that "With the participation of the UN secretary-general and the Russian and Ukrainian representatives, signatures will be put towards overcoming the problems related to the grain corridor issue, and we will give good news for the world once the agreement is signed."
His comments came before the inking ceremony of the grain export deal set to be detained at the Dolmabahce Palace with the contribution of Erdogan, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, as well as representatives from Russia and Ukraine.
