MENAFN- UkrinForm The United States follows the situation in eastern Ukraine and is ready to continue providing necessary equipment and tools to Ukraine to be able to resist Russian advances. We're concerned by every act of aggression the Russians have undertaken, every inch of Ukrainian territory they sit upon, they wreck, they bomb, they destroy, both in the areas they're moving on the ground and in the areas they're raining missiles down on from afar, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said at a press gaggle on June 8.
