'The Armed Forces of Ukraine are firmly holding the defensive positions of Kharkiv and the region. Therefore, the Russian enemy due to its powerlessness continues to 'fight' with the civilian population. Unfortunately, eight people, including a 13-year-old child, were killed as a result of daytime attacks on the city and the region. Nineteen people were wounded, including two children aged 4 and 9,' he said.
