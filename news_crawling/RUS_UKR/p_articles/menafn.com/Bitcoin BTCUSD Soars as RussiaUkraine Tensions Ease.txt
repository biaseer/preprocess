After breaking above the falling wedge earlier this month, the momentum of the bullish trend gained traction before running into a wall of resistance at $44,000, a level which continues to hold bulls at bay.
Now, as tensions between Russia and the Ukraine appear to ease, 'risk-on' sentiment has enabled BTCUSD to regain confidence as bulls aim to break through the 61. Fibonacci retracement  at $44,066. A break above that level could see a retest of $46,000 and towards the next level of $50,000.
