Dujarric publicized in a media talk that messages were given to the permanent missions of Russia and Ukraine. He commented, "In these letters, the Secretary-General asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to receive him in Moscow and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to receive him in Kyiv." Guterres said that both of these countries are important memberships of the UN and Dujarric adding to this, "have always been strong supporters of this Organization."
The UN approximated the number of the Ukrainian deaths has surged to 2,104 and 2,862 wounded from the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war and unfortunately, the real digits are believed to be more than that. The UN refugee agency documented the numbers of Ukrainian refugees over five million left Ukraine while more than seven million moved domestically. MENAFN21042022000045012476ID1104066771
