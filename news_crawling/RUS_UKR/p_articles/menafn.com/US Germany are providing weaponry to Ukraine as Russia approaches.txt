MENAFN On Wednesday June 15, the Russian military said it fired long-range missiles to strike a stockpile in Ukraine's western Lviv area where ammunition for NATO-supplied weaponry was kept, while the governor of a major eastern city admitted Russian forces are advancing in intense battle.
Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk, told the Associated Press that heavy fighting in Sievierodonetsk continues today as well. The Donbas is made up of the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Separatists supported by Russia accused Ukrainian troops of impeding an evacuation of residents from the city's beleaguered Azot chemical facility, where approximately 500 civilians and an unknown number of Ukrainian combatants are said to be hiding from missile assaults. That allegation could not be verified.
In recent weeks, Russia's onslaught has centered on the struggle for Sievierodonetsk in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.
A humanitarian corridor from the Azot facility had been declared by Russian authorities the day before, although it would lead civilians to areas controlled by Russian forces rather than Ukrainian forces.
