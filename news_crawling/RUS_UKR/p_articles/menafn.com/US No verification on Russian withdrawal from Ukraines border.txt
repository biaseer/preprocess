MENAFN On Tuesday, US president Joe Biden reported, America didnt officially confirm the withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraines border.
If Russia attacks Ukraine, it will be met with overwhelming international condemnation. The world will not forget if Russia chose needless death and destruction. Invading Ukraine will prove to be a self-inflicted wound, the president said.
He noted, And we are ready to respond decisively to a Russian attack on Ukraine, which is still very much a possibility, adding we should give the diplomacy every chance to succeed.
He stressed that the US is prepared to have diplomatic talks with Russia in a media briefing in the White House to give an update on the situation combining Russian and Ukraine.
Biden added, That would be good. And we have not yet verified that. We have not yet verified the Russian military units are returning to their home bases. Indeed, our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position. I say these things not to provoke but to speak the truth. If Russia does invade the days and weeks ahead, human costs for Ukraine will be immense.
