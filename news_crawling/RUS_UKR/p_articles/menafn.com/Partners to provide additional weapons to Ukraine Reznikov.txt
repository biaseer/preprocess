'I spent most of the night talking to my fellow defense ministers from countries that are constantly supporting us. The world's reaction is becoming clearer. We will soon receive additional reinforcements in the form of modern weapons and other resources from our partners. We have already managed to thwart the plans of the Russian occupiers. Now it is important to destroy the darkness of lies created by the Kremlin. And this will be the end of a serial killer and rapist who attacks his neighbors,' Reznikov wrote.
