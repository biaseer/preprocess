MENAFN The Ukrainian military said on Friday that it had attacked a Russian ammo storage close to a crucial bridge in the south and that it could now assault almost all of Moscow's supply routes in the seized territory.
The military reported that the attack on the depot near the town of Vesele, roughly 80 miles 130 km downstream of the massive Dnieper River from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility, claimed the lives of 11 Russian soldiers.
According to Natalia Humeniuk, the southern military command of Ukraine, practically all of Russia's supply channels are under "fire control," meaning Ukraine is free to use ranged weapons against them whenever it wants.

Our forces are controlling the situation in the south, despite the enemy trying to bring in reserves even though almost all their transport and logistical arteries have been hit or are under our fire control, she highlighted in a national broadcast. MENAFN14082022000045011137ID1104694249
