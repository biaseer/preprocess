According to the Ministry, in almost all areas of the advance, the invaders are trying to gain a foothold in the previously captured lines but have not had much success. The enemy continues to launch missile and bomb strikes on critical infrastructure, residential neighborhoods and airfields, cynically disregarding the rules of international humanitarian law.
Given the heavy combat losses of personnel and problems with the recruitment for reserve units and divisions, the command of the armed forces of the Russian Federation involves so-called 'conscripts' from the territory of CADLR, mercenaries from Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and prisoners from penitentiary facilities in the Russian Federation in combat operations in Ukraine,' the press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs.
