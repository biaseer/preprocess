'We will continue to identify and quickly direct response assets to victims of Russian cyber activity to arm our partners with the information that they need to deploy their own tools against the adversary and to attribute the misconduct and impose consequences both seen and unseen,' he added.
Away from the battlefield, even as the situation in Ukraine remains grim, Washington and Moscow have been involved in heated exchange on cyber warfare.
Russia's latest move on the issue comes after the United States had recently vowed to strengthen its national cyber defences, saying that Moscow could initiate cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in the US as a response to the 'unprecedented economic costs' imposed on it by Washington and its allies and partners.
'The FBI, along with our federal and international partners, is laser-focused on countering the significant cyber threat Russia poses to our critical infrastructure,' said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.

MENAFN- IANS By Ateet SharmaNew Delhi, March 30: Russia today said that an 'army of cyber mercenaries' from the 'collective West' assigned specific combat missions 'often bordering on open terrorism' is waging a war against it against the backdrop of ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Accusing the United States and its satellites of undertaking a massive cyber operation, Moscow stated that its state institutions, media, critical infrastructure facilities, and life support systems are subjected to powerful blows using advanced information and communication technologies every day.'At the suggestion of the Kiev regime, an 'international call' has been announced for anti-Russian computer specialists, who, in fact, form 'offensive cyber forces'. The bill for malicious attacks against us is hundreds of thousands per day,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.It added that sophisticated cyber means are being used to steal the personal data of Russian citizens, fake information is being disseminated on the internet 'with the aim of disorienting and demoralizing Russian society, discrediting the actions of the armed Forces of the Russian Federation and government agencies' besides stimulating illegal activity among the population, hindering the work of various sectors of the economy, and sowing fear and instability.'The unprecedented scope of these actions and their coordinated nature unambiguously indicate that, in addition to the Ukrainian special forces of information and technical influence trained by the United States and other NATO members, anonymous hackers and provocateurs are increasingly involved in this cyber war against us, acting on the instructions of the Western curators of the Kiev regime,' said the Russian MFA. Moscow said that its 'specialized structures' are effectively resisting these attacks, 'giving them a powerful rebuff' as strengthening ICT security in the current conditions is becoming one of the main tasks in line with the reliable provision of the country's national security.'No one should have any doubts: the cyber aggression unleashed against Russia will lead to grave consequences for its instigators and perpetrators. The sources of the attacks will be identified, the attackers will inevitably be held accountable for their deeds in accordance with the requirements of the law.'
