In his daily address on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were now lines of traffic leaving Crimea for Russia.
The blasts came exactly a week after an attack on an air base which a senior Ukrainian official speaking on condition of anonymity described as a 'well-prepared, special partisan job'.

It was the site of the last stand by anti-Bolshevik forces after the Russian Revolution of 1917 and was transferred to Soviet Ukraine after World War II.
WARSAW  Two massive attacks on Russian bases in Crimea far from the frontline in recent days have given Ukraine a boost  eight years after Russia's humiliating takeover of the strategic peninsula.
Russia's defence ministry said a series of explosions at an ammunitions storage facility near the village of Dzhankoi on Tuesday, which also damaged a railway line, were an act of 'sabotage'.
Britain's defence ministry said Russian commanders would likely beincreasingly concerned with the apparent deterioration in security across Crimea, which functions as a rear base area for the occupation.
The attacks have sparked panic among Russian tourists in Crimea and concern in Moscow that a newly-built bridge linking Russia to Crimea across the Kerch Strait could be targeted.
The absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state start to comprehend or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them.
Russian supply lines from Crimea directly support Russian forces in mainland Ukraine including those in western Kherson Oblast, it said.
Once on the fringes of the Ottoman Empire, the diamond-shaped trading hub of Crimea was captured by Russian imperialist forces in the 18th century.
The port of Sevastopol retained a special status as the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.
As the war grinds on, the aim of pushing Russian forces back to their positions before the invasion is no longer enough for many Ukrainians who want all their territory, including Crimea, back.
Russian forces eventually established a land corridor linking Crimea to Russian-held parts of eastern Ukraine  a key strategic objective.
There have also been several explosions in occupied cities believed to be the work of saboteurs.
Analyst Oliver Alexander said the explosions, which he believes might have been caused by ballistic missiles, were hitting morale on the Russian side and lifting it on the Ukrainian side.
The Institute for the Study of War in London pointed out that Tuesday's attack was on a key supply hub for Russian forces in southern Ukraine.
'Crimea has been relatively safe in the last six months. Now it isn't any longer. It does put more pressure on the Russians,' he said.

Ukraine says it has recaptured dozens of villages on the southern front and struck strategic targets including bridges in recent weeks.

On Wednesday, Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, a city close to Crimea which is under Russian occupation, said two explosions had cut the TV signal which was being supplied by Russia.
