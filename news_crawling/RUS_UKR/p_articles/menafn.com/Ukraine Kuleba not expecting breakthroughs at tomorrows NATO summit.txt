Kuleba also noted that although a number of NATO countries, despite intimidation from Russia, have consistently supported Ukraine with practical action, Kyiv lacks support from the entire alliance.
He also stressed that Ukraine does not remove the issue of closing the sky from the agenda.
'No, unfortunately, I do not expect any breakthroughs at the NATO summit because I objectively assess the situation inside the alliance and its readiness for some tough, radical action.  But we need to work, and there will definitely be a result, just over the course of time,' Kuleba said.
