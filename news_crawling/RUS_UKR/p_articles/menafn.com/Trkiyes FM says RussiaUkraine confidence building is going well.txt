Stressing that there have been "terrible wars in the history within Europe, between Turks and some Europeans," Cavusoglu stated such times ended and that "true friendship in Europe" has blossomed.
"The confidence-building measures, like exchanging war prisoners, have also been going well. We have also been mediating to that end," as announced by Mevlut Cavusoglu at a panel in the 17th Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia.
MENAFN According to Trkiye's foreign minister, confidence-building procedures between Russia and Ukraine are "going well."
"So, this war, today or tomorrow, earlier or later, will be over. We don't know how long it will take," he added, questioning if lessons would be learned from the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Moreover, asking how nations would get used to to the new realities, Cavusoglu declared a "negotiated solution" to the conflict was "much easier to reach in the initial weeks" of the war.
