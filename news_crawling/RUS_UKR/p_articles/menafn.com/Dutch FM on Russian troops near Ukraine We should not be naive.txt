Separately, Knapen expressed regret that Russia had blocked the extension of the mandate of the OSCE Observer Mission at the Russian checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk on the border with Ukraine.
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, Dutch Foreign Minister Ben Knapen said this in his speech at the 28th OSCE Ministerial Council in Stockholm on Friday, December 3.
Knapen stressed the Netherlands' support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 'We call on all parties to take steps towards a political settlement based on the Minsk agreements,' he added.
'Russia's military build-up along the border with Ukraine is increasing tensions in an already unstable situation. The past will teach us that we should not be naive. And here I also mention the tragic downing of flight MH17,' he said.
The minister also noted the particularly important role played by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. He stressed that the ongoing obstruction of observers' activity should be stopped.
