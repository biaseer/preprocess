Paris St Germain centre back Sergio Ramos said he wants to play at the highest level for another four or five years.
The 36-year-old arrived in July last year on a free transfer following 16 years at Real Madrid but has played only seven times for the Ligue 1 club due to calf problems.
Ligue 1 leaders PSG are on 71 points after 31 matches, 12 points ahead of Marseille.
'I would like to play four to five more years at the top level and then have another experience,' Ramos told Prime Video on Monday.
