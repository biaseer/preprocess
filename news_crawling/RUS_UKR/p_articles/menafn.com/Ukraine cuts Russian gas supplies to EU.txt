Gazprom's spokesperson updated journalists Gazprom is supplying Russian gas for transit through Ukraine in the volume confirmed by the Ukrainian side through the Sudzha gas metering station  41.7 million cubic meters as of August 1. The application to reopen the Sohranovka gas metering system has been rejected.
MENAFN Russias EU-bound natural gas deliveries, pumped through Ukraine, are cut to one remaining entry point, while Kiev did not agree on reviving another transit station, according to energy giant Gazprom on Monday.
Ukraine closed shipment via the Sokhranovka station, which have almost a third of the Russian gas flowing thru the nation to the EU, in early May, mentioning interference by the occupying forces.
Kiev called for Gazprom to send all gas transit to the Sudzha pumping station in the Kursk Region, which Gazprom eliminated as technically difficult.
