MENAFN While Russia's conflict in Ukraine continues, the international community has been reminded of the war in Yemen, which has resulted in one of the gravest global humanitarian catastrophes this year, with 19 million citizens suffering starvation.
More has to be done to aid the Arab world's poorest nation, where 160,000 citizen  are set to experience famine-like conditions, according to UN humanitarian director Martin Griffiths.
Yemen has become a "chronic emergency," according to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, which might lead to donor weariness.
