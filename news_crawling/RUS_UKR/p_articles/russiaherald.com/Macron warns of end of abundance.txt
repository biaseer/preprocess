France is heading toward a difficult period of ?anxiety,? requiring 'sacrifices? to be made, the president said
France is headed toward the "end of abundance" and "sacrifices" have to be made during what is a time of great upheaval, President Emmanuel Macron told his cabinet on Wednesday upon returning from summer break.
The country has faced multiple challenges lately, ranging from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine to the unprecedented drought that has battered the whole European continent this summer. Yet, Macron believes that the crisis is actually of a much bigger scale and that structural changes are imminent.
The country and its citizens must be ready to make "sacrifices" to meet and overcome the challenges they are facing, he continued. "Our system based on freedom in which we have become used to living, when we need to defend it sometimes that can entail making sacrifices," Macron added.
"Faced with this, we have duties, the first of which is to speak frankly and very clearly without doom-mongering," Macron stressed. The president called upon his cabinet to show unity, be "serious" and "credible" and urged ministers to avoid "demagogy."
"It's easy to promise anything and everything, sometimes to say anything and everything. Do not give in to these temptations, it is demagoguery," the president said, adding that such an approach "flourishes" today "in all democracies in a complex and frightening world."
"Some could see our destiny as being to constantly manage crises or emergencies. I believe that we are living through a tipping point or great upheaval. Firstly, because we are living through... what could seem like the end of abundance," he said.
