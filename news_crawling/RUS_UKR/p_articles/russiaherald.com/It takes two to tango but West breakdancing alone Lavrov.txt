"Former German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron voiced very serious disappointment with the EU's Russophobes, who had blocked an initiative by France and Germany to conduct a summit between the EU and Russian President Putin," Lavrov replied. In 2021, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel offered to invite Russia for talks, but faced opposition from leaders of the bloc.
Both are "reasonable politicians, who understand the need to find a way out of the crisis," Lavrov said.
The foreign minister explained that in the past he had heard "other reactions from Paris and Berlin."
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron have been holding talks with Moscow after the military campaign against Ukraine was launched in late February. Their latest trilateral call with President Putin took place in late May.
While speaking about the inadmissibility of any dialogue with Russia, "our Polish colleagues start to actively develop Ukrainian territory," Lavrov noted.
The minister was asked by an RT correspondent on Friday about recent comments made by Polish President Andrzej Duda, in which he criticized France and Germany for continuing toconductphone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
