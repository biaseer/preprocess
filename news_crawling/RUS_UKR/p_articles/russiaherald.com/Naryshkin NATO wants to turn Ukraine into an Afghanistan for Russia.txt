According to Naryshkin, the US is trying at the same time to prevent the current escalation of the situation in Ukraine so that it does not spread to the West.
In statements to RIA Novosti, Naryshkin added that Washington would like to make this conflict as costly as possible to Moscow and Kyiv by using the dirtiest methods, including sending militants to organize underground movements.
He pointed out that American strategists want to turn Ukraine into a new Afghanistan for Russia, but it is clear that the US has failed strategically in that.
Moscow, SANA- Head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin, said that the US considers that its main task is to prolong the conflict in Ukraine as much as possible.
