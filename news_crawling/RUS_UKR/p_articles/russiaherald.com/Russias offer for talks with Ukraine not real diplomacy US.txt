Washington US, February 26 ANI: Amid the growing tensions between Moscow and Kiev, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Russia's diplomacy takes place at the barrel of a gun and termed it "not real diplomacy.""Moscow engaged in a pretence of diplomacy that was before the invasion started. Now we see Moscow suggesting that diplomacy take place at the barrel of a gun or as Moscow's rocket, mortars target the Ukrainian people, this is not real diplomacy," US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during the press briefing.
"We and our Allies have called for a real diplomatic solution from day one, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly reached out to President Putin but his outstretched hand at every turn was met by silence and now bombs," Price said.
"If President Vladimir Putin is serious about diplomacy, he knows what he can do. He should immediately stop bombing campaign against civilians, order withdrawal of his forces from Ukraine and indicate very clearly to the world that Moscow is prepared to de-escalate. We've not seen any indication that Putin is willing to de-escalate," he said.
