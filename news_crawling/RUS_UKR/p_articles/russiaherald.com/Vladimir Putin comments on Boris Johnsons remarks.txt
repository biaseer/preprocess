"I don't know how they wanted to undress, waist-high or not, but I think it would be a disgusting sight either way," the Russian president quipped. "Everything should be harmoniously developed in a person, both the body and the soul. However, in order for everything to be harmonious, one has to abandon excessive drinkingand break other bad habits, start exercising, take up a sport."
"So coming from an acting British Prime Minister, this is not exactly a correct remark in regards to what is happening today."
Vladimir Putin visitedAshgabat, Turkmenistan, on Wednesday, during his first foreign trip since the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine. He attended the sixth Caspian summit, meeting with the leaders of Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The day before that, he visited Tajikistan and met with its president Emomali Rahmon.
Speaking to journalists in Turkmenistan on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putinresponded to questions about several recent remarks from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. During the latest G7 summit, the UK leader joked that his allies should take their clothes off for the photoshoot - to show that they are "tougher than Putin."
The Russian leader responded: "I just want to remind you about the events of modern history, when Margaret Thatcher made a decision to launch military action against Argentina over the Falkland Islands. Here's a woman, deciding to launch military action. Where are the Falkland Islands and where is Britain? And this was dictated by nothing but imperial ambitions."
Johnson's another recent remark suggested that what he described as a "macho war of invasion"in Ukraine would not happen "if Putin was a woman,which he obviously isn't."
