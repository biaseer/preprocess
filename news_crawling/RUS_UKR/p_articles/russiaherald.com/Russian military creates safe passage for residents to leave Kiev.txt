The call came on Monday as Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to start peace talks in Belarus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a public address that he had low expectations for the negotiations. His country does not intend to surrender, he added.
The Ukrainian government earlier distributed firearms to civilians, released felons with military experience from prison, and called on the people to prepare firebombs to fight Russian troops.
Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko told AP on Sunday that the city was fully encircled by Russian troops, but backtracked on the claim later.
The ministry said that Russia "only attacks military objects" and claimed that the civilian population would not be at risk.
The Russian Defense Ministry has called on Ukrainian civilians to evacuate from Kiev. They can do so by taking the highway towards Vasilkov, a city located 20km southwest of the capital, it said in a statement on Monday, adding, "This direction is open and safe."
Russia attacked Ukraine on Thursday, claiming that the country had to be demilitarized and "denazified" to protect the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, as well as Russia.
