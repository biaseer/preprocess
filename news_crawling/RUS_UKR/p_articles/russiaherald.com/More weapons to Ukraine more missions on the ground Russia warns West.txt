"Pumping up" Ukraine with Western weapons will only lead Russia "to perform more missions on the ground," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday.
"The more weapons are pumped into Ukraine, the longer this conflict will last, the longer the agony of the Nazi regime, which is supported by Western capitals, will last," he said, commenting on the accusations of Ukrainian and Western politicians related to a shopping mall in Kremenchug, Ukraine, which was allegedly hit by Russian forces on Monday.
"Pumping up" Ukraine with weapons will make Russian forces "perform more missions on the ground," Moscow has said
Lavrov's remarks came as the G7 leaders agreed to continue supporting Ukraine, both militarily and financially, "for as long as it takes."
"I am saying it to emphasize the fact that the longer weapons are supplied, which are designed to prolong the conflict, prolong the suffering of civilians who constantly live under shelling by the Ukrainian neo-Nazi movement, the more missions we will perform on the ground," Lavrov said.
Lavrov referred to an earlier statement by the Russian Defense Ministry, according to which the military targeted a hangar with American and European weapons and ammunition. The detonations that resulted set fire to the mall, which was empty, the foreign minister stressed.
Speaking at a press conference, the foreign minister stated that the position of the West regarding Ukraine is "absolutely counterproductive and harmful."
