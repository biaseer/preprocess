In the area of Velyka Oleksandrivka, a village in the Kherson region largely controlled by Russians, Ukrainian forces destroyed an ammunition depot and "eliminated" more than 70 Russian troops, the General Staff said.
Nearly 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion two months ago, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that three million more were expected to follow this year.
A senior Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said last week that Russian forces aim to take full control of southern Ukraine, saying such a move would open the way to Transdniestria.
The occupation lasted until the end of March and raised global fears of nuclear leaks.
Russian forces are shelling Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, as they fought to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to Ukraine's General Staff.
While stopping short of backing Kyiv's contention that Russia was responsible for the incidents in Transnistria, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters: "We do remain concerned about any potential attempts to escalate tensions."
While the United States would support Ukrainian efforts to end the war diplomatically, Blinken said: "Our purpose is to make sure that they have within their hands the ability to repel the Russian aggression and, indeed, to strengthen their hand at an eventual negotiating table."
The incident occurred in the small town of Maiac, roughly 12 kilometres 7 miles west of the border, according to the region's interior ministry. It came a day after several explosions were reported to have hit a security building in the city of Tiraspol, the region's capital.
Russia is attempting to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which comprise the Donbas in Ukraine's industrial heartland, and establish a land corridor to Crimea.
"Ukraine has now beaten back the Russian military for 62 days. Your resistance has brought inspiration to the free world and even greater resolve for NATO," said Austin. "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does everyone here," he said, calling on participants to step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself.
"The scale of the crisis, definitely the rapidity of people fleeing, we have not seen in recent times," said Mantoo.
Russia has warned of the "real" threat of World War III breaking out, ahead of a Tuesday meeting between the United States and allies over sending further arms to war-torn Ukraine.
More than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine during the past two months, including 7.7 million people who are internally displaced and more than 5 million who have fled over borders, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a UN news briefing.
In total, 5,264,767 people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February 24, according to the latest data from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.
No one was hurt in Tuesday's explosions, officials said. The two antennas were used for broadcasting Russian radio shows.
Additionally, the British government said it would also impose further export bans on products to Russia, including cash, maritime goods and technology, and energy-related goods. Last week, it ramped up sanctions on luxury goods including caviar, silver and diamonds.
Transdniestria, a strip of land with about 470,000 people between Moldova and Ukraine, has been under the control of Moscow-backed separatist authorities since 1992.
The US meanwhile has been rushing more weaponry to Ukraine and said the assistance from Western allies is making a difference in the 2-month-old war.
Blinken was opening three days of testimony to Congress after a surprise visit alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv on Sunday where the top US officials met President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"He has to choose," he told Welt TV. "Either he keeps supporting Putin, or he is a member of the Social Democrats, but the two are not compatible.
US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.
Reporting from Kyiv, FRANCE 24's Gulliver Cragg says the Russian offensive continues in the Donbas region and in southern Ukraine, but without much progress on the ground. Russian forces are targeting railways, noted Cragg, "because they think this is how weapons are being supplied to Ukrainian forces". The targeting comes as the US hosts a key meeting at Germany's Ramstein Air Base aimed at getting European partners to offer more military assistance to Ukraine.
While the outflow has slowed significantly since March, UNHCR said Tuesday see 11:31am, below that it now projects that three million more Ukrainians could become refugees by the end of the year.
"We've seen no sign to date that President Putin is serious about meaningful negotiations," Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Moscow's invasion of its neighbour has triggered an outburst of support from Western nations that has seen weapons pour into the country to help it wage war against Russian troops.
Kuleba on Monday told The Associated Press that he was concerned that by visiting Moscow, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin "trap" in the war.
The paper said German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht was set to offer the weapons at the US-hosted meeting at Ramstein Air Base.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday discussed Moscow's efforts to ensure the safety of civilians during its military operation in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.

Poland's state gas company, PGNiG, said it was notified by Russian gas giant Gazprom that deliveries through the Yamal-Europe pipeline would stop on Wednesday.
London said tariffs would be reduced to zero and all quotas removed following a direct request from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying the move would provide a boost for Ukrainian businesses involved in key exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the explosions in Transdniestria was a cause for serious concern and that Moscow was following the events closely.
Amid growing concern for the thousands of people trapped in Mariupol, Guterres said the UN was ready to act.
Schroeder, who is a lobbyist for Russian gas and has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, sparked fresh outrage following remarks in an interview with the New York Times published this weekend.
"Lavrov's trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado," Heappey told the BBC. "What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated ... Everything we do is calibrated to avoid direct confrontation with Russia."
"We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a ceasefire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution," Guterres said.
"Ukrainian forces have been preparing defences in Zaporizhzhia in preparation for a potential Russian attack from the south," said the defence ministry in its regular military intelligence bulletin.
Speaking at the start of talks with Lavrov, Guterres called for a ceasefire "as soon as possible" and stressed the need to do everything possible to end the war in Ukraine.
His schedule includes meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov before the UN chief heads to Kyiv.
"After all, missiles could hit one or more nuclear facility, and this threatens a nuclear and radiation catastrophe around the world," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by Energoatom on the Telegram messaging app.
The US State Department on Tuesday criticized Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's comments about the potential of a nuclear war, saying loose talk about nuclear escalation was the "height of irresponsibility."
"The donor community is, not NATO," Heappey told Sky News when asked about Lavrov's comments.
Energoatom said Russian troops, who have occupied the plant since March 4, were keeping heavy equipment and ammunition on the site.
Guterres reiterated his call from an earlier meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov see 2:02pm, below for Moscow and Kyiv to work together with the UN to set up aid and evacuation corridors to help civilians in Ukraine.
Four people died and nine more were wounded on Monday in the Russian shelling of the Donetsk region, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. He said a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed.
During the meeting, Erdogan also said Turkey would continue to work closely with the UN to end the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.
"Today's gathering will become a monthly Contact Group on Ukraine's self-defence," he said following the first session of a weapons summit with officials from around 40 countries at the United States' Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation from Mariupol, where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped in the port city while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant along with hundreds of civilians.
"Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many have evacuated," Guterres told the news conference.
The Russian leader told him that "the city is liberated and combat operations are not going on there".
"The United Nations is ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol," he said, adding that coordination with the Red Cross could allow those holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to leave.
"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters en route to Germany. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that's really the purpose of this conference."
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has stressed France's "determination to continue and deepen" its "support to Ukraine in all areas".
Russia bases about 1,500 troops there, nominally as peacekeepers, but concerns are high that the forces could be used to invade Ukraine.
Police in the Moldovan separatist region of Transdniestria said two explosions Tuesday morning in a radio facility close to the Ukrainian border knocked two antennas out of service.
Russia's Vladimir Putin told the visiting UN chief Antonio Guterres on Tuesday that he still had hope for negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. Earlier, after talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, Guterres had called for independent probes into "possible war crimes" in Ukraine. Late Tuesday, Russia's Gazprom told Poland and Bulgaria it would halt gas supplies from Wednesday. Follow FRANCE 24's liveblog for all the latest developments. All times are in Paris time GMT  2.
Earlier Lavrov said the risks of nuclear conflict should not be underestimated, but Heappey dismissed the warning as "bravado".
"We stand unwaveringly with Ukraine in this ongoing fight and will work to ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation," said British International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan.
"It is visible that there is damage and we are assessing that," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told a news conference in Kyiv after visiting the station.
"The donor effort is something that has been brought together by countries that are yes, many of them are from NATO, but others are from beyond ... it is not NATO that is doing the military aid," said Heappey, adding that he did not think there was an "imminent threat" of escalation in Ukraine.
Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa stressed that Poland was prepared for such a situation after working for years to reduce its reliance on Russian energy sources. She said the country has been effectively independent when it comes to Russian gas for some time.
He also called for the establishment of a humanitarian contact group that would bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the UN to "look for opportunities for the creation of humanitarian corridors" in parts of Ukraine.
Opening the gathering of representatives of more than 40 countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin called on members of the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group to arrive at "a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine's near-term security requirements because we're going to move heaven and earth so that we can meet them".
"According to Russia, it is a 'special military operation' with limited objectives. According to the UN in line with resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the charter of the United Nations," Guterres said.
"The next several weeks will be very, very critical," Milley told reporters travelling with him. "They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that's really the purpose of this conference."
Following a weekend trip to Kyiv, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding talks focused on arming Ukraine.
Ukraine's state-run atomic energy company said Russian missiles flew at low altitude over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest - on Tuesday.
US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a key goal of the talks was to synchronise and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition.
"Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once by Russian forces. How can it be otherwise?" Lavrov said. "NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."
Deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the NATO alliance is "in essence engaged in war with Russia" and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview aired on Monday.
In an intelligence update posted on Twitter, Britain's Defence Ministry said the Ukrainian city of Kreminna has "probably fallen" and there was heavy fighting south of the city of Izium, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from the north and east.

"There was a provocation in the village of Bucha, which the Russian army had nothing to do with," Putin said. "We know who prepared this provocation, by what means, and what kind of people worked on it."
Russia's Gazprom has informed Bulgarian state gas company Bulgargaz it will halt gas supplies as of Wednesday, the energy ministry said on Tuesday.
The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said on the messaging app Telegram that the Russians had shelled civilians 17 times over the previous 24 hours, with the cities of Popasna, Lysychansk and Girske suffering the most.

The Gepard anti-aircraft system is considered the cornerstone of the German military's air defence capability.
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is holding the event at Ramstein Air Base in Germany following a weekend trip to Kyiv where he pledged additional support to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's war effort.
Speaking to Russian news agencies, Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the risk of a World War III "is serious" and criticised Kyiv's approach to floundering peace talks.
Austin, who is chairing the meeting at the US air base, said Kyiv had done "an impressive job defending its sovereignty against Russia's unprovoked invasion", adding: ""Ukraine's valor and skill will go down in military history."
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday said he had agreed with Ukraine to help repair the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant after it was occupied by Russian troops.
Lavrov warned the West on Monday not to underestimate the elevated risks of nuclear conflict over Ukraine and said he viewed NATO as being "in essence" engaged in a proxy war with Russia by supplying Kyiv with weaponry.
UNHCR had previously planned for some 4 million refugees in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, but this was surpassed last month.

Putin told Guterres he was "aware of your concerns about Russia's military operation" in Ukraine and ready to discuss it, but blamed the turmoil in the country on an "anti-state coup" that overturned a pro-Russian president in 2014.
Guterres and Erdogan "reaffirmed that their common objective is to end the war as soon as possible and to create conditions to end the suffering of civilians," said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.

This came as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during a visit to Russia Tuesday urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors.
But Western powers have been reluctant to deepen their involvement, for fear of sparking a conflict against nuclear-armed Russia.
"We reiterate the Moldovan government's call for calm in response to these incidents and we fully support Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty," Price said.
