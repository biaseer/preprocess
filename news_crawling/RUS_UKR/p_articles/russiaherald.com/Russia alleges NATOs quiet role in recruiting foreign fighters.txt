NGOs as well as Ukraine's diplomats are searching internationally for soldiers of fortune to fight against Russia, Moscow says
"Russia is closely monitoring the recruitment of foreign citizens carried out by the Ukrainian authorities with the quite support of some NATO countries to conduct warfare in eastern Ukraine on the side of the Kiev regime," Vladimir Tarabrin, who heads the department of new challenges and threats at the ministry, told RIA Novosti news agency.
Several NATO member states are 'quietly' supporting Kiev's efforts to sign up foreign mercenaries to fight in the ongoing conflict with Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
Tarabrin also alleged that NGOs, as well as Ukrainian diplomatic missions overseas, are involved in hiring mercenaries, adding that such actions by Kiev are a violation of international agreements, including the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
