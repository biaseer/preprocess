KIEV, July 13 Xinhua -- Ukraine and Russia have made some progress at the talks on grain exports in Istanbul that also involved representatives of Turkey and the United Nations, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Wednesday.

Ukraine is making significant efforts to restore the supplies of food to the global market, he said.
