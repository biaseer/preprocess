"I have already shipped over USD 600 million worth of sophisticated defence equipment to the Ukrainians. The cost of going into Ukraine in terms of physical loss of life for Russians is going to be heavy, real and consequential," Biden addedThe US expects that Putin will be moving his 100,000 troops after amassing them along the Ukraine border.
But he suggested a "minor incursion" would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion of the country. Biden said that the level of punishment would depend on what Russia's invasion looks like.
He warned Russian President Vladimir Putin of significant economic consequences when such an incursion occurs. "He Russian President Vladimir Putin has never seen sanctions like the ones I have promised will be imposed if Russia further advances into Ukraine," said Biden.
"I'm not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something," Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world. "He is trying to find his place in the world between China and the West."Biden made the remarks at the formal news conference marking his first year in office. ANI
