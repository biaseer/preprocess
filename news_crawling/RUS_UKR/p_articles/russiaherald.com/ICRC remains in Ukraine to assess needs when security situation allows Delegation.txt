Moscow Russia, February 26 ANISputnik: The International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC will continue operating in Ukraine and plans to evaluate the emerging needs of the population when the situation allows it to do so, the ICRC delegation in the country told Sputnik on Friday.
"Our teams are in place across Ukraine and when the security situation allows we'll be out assessing needs and responding as best as we can, to assist and support people," the delegation said, adding that "we have more than 600 staff in the country and along with helping people affected by the conflict and intensification, those teams' safety and security is one of our top priorities."The delegation described the current escalation of the conflict as "frightening to contemplate," noting that it is causing a displacement of civilians.
