Zakharova was responding to comments by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who described the attack as "barbarism" and claimed "Russian Kalibr missiles destroyed the very possibility of statements" on the need for dialogue and any agreements with Moscow.
The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to officially comment on the explosions that rocked Odessa, which is a major trade hub in the southwest of Ukraine. Throughout the conflict with Kiev, Moscow has insisted that it does not target civilians, only Ukraine's armed forces and military infrastructure.
The high-precision strike sent a Ukrainian military vessel to the bottom of the Black Sea, she added.
"The Kalibr missiles destroyed part of the military infrastructure in the port of Odessa," Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram on Sunday.
Russia says it hit a military target during a Saturday strike on the Ukrainian port city of Odessa. The attack came a day after the signing of a UN-brokered deal to unblock grain exports from Ukrainian ports.
