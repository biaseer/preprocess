"Our US and British colleagues... with the support from the Germans, Poles, and the Baltic states, very much want to make this war a real war, pitting Russia against European countries," Lavrov said, speaking to RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan.
The Western governments are "literally holding Ukraine back from any constructive steps" towards a peace settlement, Lavrov argued. They are not only "flooding" the country with weapons, but "forcing" Ukraine to use them more brazenly, he added.
Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country in late February. Many countries, including NATO members, imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow and have been supplying Kiev with heavy weapons. The latest deliveries include US-made M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers and M777 howitzers.
The US and UK want to escalate the Russia-Ukraine conflict into a larger confrontation between Moscow and Europe, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday in an interview with RT and Sputnik.
