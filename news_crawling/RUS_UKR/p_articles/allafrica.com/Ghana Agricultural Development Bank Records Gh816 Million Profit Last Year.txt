"Our target is to bring the NPL ratio within industry bracket of 14 per cent by 2023," he said.
DaasebreAgyapong II, who is the Kwawuhene and the President of the Kwahu Traditional Council, said the bank's performance last year resulted in Return on Equity and Return on Assets of 12.09 per cent and 1.81 against 7.69 per cent and 1.14 per cent respectively.
The Board Chairman said the capital adequacy ratio was 14.49 per cent and above the regulatory minimum of 11.5 per cent.
Mr Mensah called on all stakeholders in the country to support agriculture, stressing that "Agric is an area many institutions must be sacrificed to be there."
"Every economy depends on the agriculture sector. Had it not been the good efforts of the agriculture sector, coronavirus would have damaged the economy more than we saw."
He said interest income grew from GH415.4 million in 2020 to GH480.3 million in 2021 and operating income soared from GH555.9 million in 2020 to GH639.9 million in 2021.
The Managing Director said ADB would continue to support the agriculture sector to thrive because the COVID-19 pandemic had had negative effect on the sector.
This represents an increase of 24.8 per cent growth of the GH65.4 million profit recorded the previous year.
Managing Director of ADB, Dr John Kofi Mensah, in an interview said the bank would continue to put in place measures and strategies to reduce NPLs.
The Board Chairman of ADB, Daasebre AkuamoahAgyapong II, disclosing this at ADB's 2022 and 35th Annual General Meeting in Accra yesterday, said the performance of the bank was driven by improvement in interest income as a result of the growth in loans and advances.
He said assets of the bank grew to GH6.45 million in 2021 from GH5.72 million in 2020, and deposits grew 15 per cent from GH4.2 billion in 2020 to GH4.9 billion.
He indicated that the new Board would review the strategy at the end of its implementation period and adopt a new strategy starting from 2023.
"We remain confident of the prospects of the bank and the fact that we are on the right track towards full recovery," the Board Chairman assured.
Agricultural Development Bank ADB in spite of the difficult economic challenges last year, posted an impressive performance with a profit after tax of GH81.6 million.
DaasebreAgyapong II said the strategic direction of the new Board would continue to focus on agriculture since that was the core business of the bank.
"The reconstituted board continued with the implementation of the Strategic Plan of the bank adopted for the period 2020 to 2020 and the associated annual budgets," DaasebreAgyapong II said.
"The size of our balance sheet grew over the year from GH5.7 billion to GH6.5 billion in 2021 representing 12.9 per cent growth," the Board Chairman said.
He pledged that ADB would continue to focus on agriculture in spite that the sector was difficult and risky, indicating that in the poultry industry if a disease sets in one was likely to lose all the birds.
Daasebre Agyapong II stated that Non-Performing Loan portfolio of the bank witnessed a reduction from 34 per cent in 2020 to 31 per cent in 2021.
Dr Mensah said the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukraine conflict had dealt a big blow to agriculture.
