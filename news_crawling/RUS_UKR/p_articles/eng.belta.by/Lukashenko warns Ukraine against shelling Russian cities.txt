"Yesterday Biden U.S. President Joe Biden said that they would give Ukraine one and a half billion dollars every month. Why? To keep the war going. So this is just the beginning. The big job is ahead of them, the mighty of the world, namely re-division of the world. Americans feel that they are losing ground. But they do not want to lose because their wellbeing depends on this. They want to be on top and run the world," the Belarusian leader added.
Aleksandr Lukashenko noted that the entire West got involved in the war. For the time being Russia is using conventional weapons. Yet Russia has enough other weapons. "Ukrainians, Zelensky are asking for long-range weapons to reach Russian cities: Kursk, Rostov, Oryol, Belgorod, i.e. the neighboring cities. But, as I once said, in no case they should do it. Because Russia will opt to use a new level of weapons and will use them against Kiev, against those who make these decisions. This is why they are still hesitating. But this decision does not depend on them. This all depends on the Americans, on how hard they will push them for this," the president said.
