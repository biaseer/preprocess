We are deeply convinced that by supplying arms to Ukraine the West seeks to keep the military confrontation on the boil as long as possible. The active disposal of outdated or non-NATO-standard weapons in battles on Ukrainian territory serves the interests of the North American defense industry. We are fully aware that the ability of the defense complex of European countries to replenish their weapons stockpiles are very limited, and we see that the stocks of aircraft, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, missiles that European countries are sending to Ukraine are replenished not by European, but by American weapons. In other words, Europe's money is once again flowing into America, Viktor Khrenin said.
The USA is profiting from the war in Europe again, Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said as he addressed the tenth edition of the Moscow Conference on International Security in the Russian capital on 16 August, BelTA has learned.
It is no coincidence that since February the capitalization of American arms corporations has grown by tens of billions of dollars. Once again, the Americans are solving their economic issues and earning money from the war going across the ocean, the defense minister stressed.
The Moscow security forum has brought together more than 700 guests, including defense ministers, chiefs of general staff, delegations of the military departments, representatives of the expert community from different states, as well as representatives of international organizations. The conference focuses on global and regional stability, and various aspects of security in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.
