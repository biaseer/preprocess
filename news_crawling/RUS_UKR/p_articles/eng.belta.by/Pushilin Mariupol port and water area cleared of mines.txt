"The seaport of Mariupol reopened on 28 May. Electricity and water are yet to be supplied, but we will resolve all these issues soon. Products have already been shipped for foreign markets. We've also received deliveries of imported goods. Basically, we ship metal, coal and grain. As for imports, these are building materials, in huge quantities, which are needed to rebuild cities of the Donetsk People's Republic," Denis Pushilin said about the port operations.
According to him, the port and water area has been cleared of mines. During mine clearance, about 12,000 explosive objects were neutralized. "In order for the port to work at full capacity, we need to supply electricity and water. These works are being carried out at an accelerated pace. According to preliminary estimates, they will be completed within two or three weeks. We need to prepare for the winter, to rebuild the destroyed buildings, cranes. We have taken stock of the work to be done and mapped out a plan of action. We hope to do all this before the winter sets in," Denis Pushilin said.
The Russian Federation is the main partner for import and export for the DPR. "The volume of export depends on the opportunities and the number of willing. We have no problems with the latter. There are a large number of farms in the liberated territories. We have large volumes of harvest not only that of this year, but also of last year," the head of the DPR said.
