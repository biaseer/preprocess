MINSK, 14 February BelTA - Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko spoke about the date for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarus as he met with Ukrainian politician and statesman Alexander Moroz in Minsk on 14 February, BelTA has learned.
"Look at what the Americans are doing: they are deploying thousands to our border: in Poland, the Baltic states. The UK and other European countries are sending their troops here. We have a reasonable question: when will they get them out of here? They don't speak about it but instead are putting pressure on us. We will withdraw them when the Russian president and I decide and when the exercise ends. It is up to us to make the decision: this is our territory."
