The Government, which has announced a visa waiver for Ukrainians trying to enter Ireland, was urged to do all it can to support the country.
She said that the entire world needs to support Ukraine against actions of Russian and Mr Putin.
The entrance to the Russian Embassy on the south side of Dublin was splashed with red paint on Thursday morning, as news broke of the Russian attack.
Inside the Irish parliament, politicians spent much of Thursday reacting to the crisis in eastern Europe.
Dozens of Ukrainians gathered outside the Dil on Thursday to express their anger at the Russian assault on their country.
The crowd chanted, waved Ukrainian flags and carried placards attacking the full-scale invasion launched by Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Irish politicians joined the protesters over the course of the afternoon, including deputy premier Leo Varadkar and chairman of the Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee Charlie Flanagan.
