Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies and the lack of significant grain exports from Ukraine ports is contributing to a growing global food crisis.
Britain said on Tuesday there are no plans to send British warships to help get food exports out of the blockaded Ukrainian port of Odesa.
Ukraines Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 and more than 20 million tons of grain are stuck in silos in the country.
And it also requires the demining by the Ukrainian side of all ports where ships are anchored. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian passage, which it does every day.
Russia is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions, the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying on Wednesday.
We have repeatedly stated on this point that a solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions, Rudenko was quoted as saying.
Russia is in touch with the United Nations on the issue, Rudenko was quoted as saying by another news agency, RIA.
Western powers have been discussing the idea of setting up safe corridors for grain exports from Ukraines ports, adding that any such corridor would need Russian consent.
Rudenko was also quoted by Interfax as saying that possible escort by Western ships of Ukraines vessels carrying grain would seriously exacerbate the situation in the Black Sea.
On the shallow-water Azov Sea, Russias defense ministry said on Wednesday that the port of Mariupol, the Ukrainian city which was taken by Russia, is operating normally after Russian forces completed removing mines from there.
