He handed himself in voluntarily and should be treated as a prisoner of war, the father said.
We as a family suffer from the absence of contact with the lawyer to exchange legal information and this adds to our ordeal, he said.
RABAT: The father of a Moroccan man sentenced to death by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic DPR on mercenary charges said his son should be treated as a prisoner of war as he is a Ukrainian national who handed himself in voluntarily.
The Moroccan fighter received Ukrainian nationality in 2020 after undergoing a year of military training as a requirement to access aerospace technology studies at a university in Kiev, his father Tahar Saadoun said in an email to Reuters.
Morocco-born Brahim Saadoun and Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were found guilty of mercenary activities and committing actions aimed at seizing power and overthrowing the constitutional order of the DPR, Russian media said last week.
