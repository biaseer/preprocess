Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbors military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.
Russias communications watchdog said earlier this month that it was taking steps to punish Google for spreading fakes on YouTube, and has previously warned the US company that it would be fined if it failed to comply.
Russia fined Alphabet Inc.s Google $50,000 4 million roubles for failing to delete what it terms fake information about its special operation in Ukraine, the TASS news agency reported on Thursday.
