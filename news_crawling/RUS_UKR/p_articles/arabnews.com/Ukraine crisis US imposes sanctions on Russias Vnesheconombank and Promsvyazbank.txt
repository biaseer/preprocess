It follows similar moves by the UK, on Feb. 21, which also slapped sanctions on five Russian banks including Rossiya and Promsvyazbank PSB UK andnotablebillionaires with close links to Putin.
"These prohibitions will cut off the Russian government from a key avenue by which it raises capital to fund its priorities and will increase future financing costs. It denies Russia access to key US markets and investors," said the White House in a statement.
The decision from the US comes after Russian President Vladimir Putinrecognized two Ukrainian regions,Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.
The sanction from the United States will freeze the assets ofthese two large state-owned Russian financial institutions and will prohibit US citizens and businesses from doing any transactions with them.
Amid ongoing tensions, Germany had also halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project which was designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany.
The move by the United States is designed to cripple banking activities and may shut these institutions out of the global financial system.
In retaliation against Russia's moves in Ukrainianborders, the United States has imposed sanctions on two banks, Vnesheconombank VEB and Promsvyazbank, for their alleged role in supporting the Russian military.
