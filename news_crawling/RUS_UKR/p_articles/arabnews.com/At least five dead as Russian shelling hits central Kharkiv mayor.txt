The Russian occupiers shelled the central districts of Kharkiv, Synegubov said on Telegram, as he warned residents to stay inside the shelters.
KYIV: At least five people were killed on Tuesday as Russian shelling hit the center of Ukraines second city of Kharkiv, the mayor said.
It has been heavily bombarded throughout the conflict, with hundreds of people killed, officials say.
Located in northeastern Ukraine just 50 kilometers 30 miles from the Russian border, Kharkiv managed to repel efforts by Moscows forces to take the city, which had a population of some 1.4 million residents before the war.
