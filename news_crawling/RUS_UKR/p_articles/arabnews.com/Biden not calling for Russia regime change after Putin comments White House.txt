The president's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region,a White House official said minutes after the speech concluded.
Bidens speech was delivered at Warsaws Royal Castle before hundreds of Polish elected officials, students and US embassy staff, many holding US, Polish and Ukrainian flags.
We stand with you,he told Ukrainians in thesweeping speech, which he began with the words of late Polish pope John Paul II: Be not afraid.
WARSAW: Joe Biden is not seeking regime changein Russia, the White House said Saturday, after the US president declared in a major speech that Vladimir Putin cannot stay in power.
Calling the fight against Vladimir Putin a new battle for freedom, Biden said Putins desire for absolute power was a strategic failure for Russia and a direct challenge to a European peace that has largely prevailed since World War Two.
He said Russia had suffered a strategic failurein Ukraine and told ordinary Russians they were not our enemy, urging them to blame Putin for the heavy sanctions imposed by the West.
Asked about Biden's comment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters: That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians.
We will have a different future, a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, he added.
He also warned Russia not to move on an inch" of NATO territory, reiterating the sacred obligationof collective defence for alliance members.
Still, the commentscame on a day of escalating rhetoric as Biden also described branded Putin a butcher during a meeting with refugees who have fled the war in Ukraine to the Polish capital.
On Saturday, Biden said the West was united against Russias invasion but also added that NATO was a defensive security alliance which never sought Russias demise.
