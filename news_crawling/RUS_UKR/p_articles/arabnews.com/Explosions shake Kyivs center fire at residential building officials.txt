Kyivs mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that residents are being rescued and evacuated from two buildings.
Since then Moscow and its proxies have focused on the south and Donbas, an eastern territory made up of Luhansk and its neighbor Donetsk, deploying overwhelming artillery in some of the heaviest ground fighting in Europe since World War Two.
KYIV: Several explosions shook Kyivs central Shevchenkivskiy district early on Sunday, causing a widespread damage and a fire at a residential building, officials said, in the first assault on Ukraines capital since early June.
The Shevchenkivskiy historic district, one of Kyivs central, is home to a cluster of universities, restaurants and art galleries.
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, but abandoned an early advance on Kyiv in the face of fierce resistance bolstered by Western arms.
Emergency services said that as a result of the Russian shelling a fire broke out in a 9-story residential building that had been partially damaged in the attack.
Air raid sirens regularly disrupt life in Kyiv, but there have been no major strikes on the city since June 5 when a rail car repair facility was hit on the outskirts and a late April shelling when a Radio Liberty producer was killed in a strike that hit the building she lived in.
They the rescuers have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now theyre trying to rescue her mother.
There are people under the rubble, Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. He added that several people had already been hospitalized.
