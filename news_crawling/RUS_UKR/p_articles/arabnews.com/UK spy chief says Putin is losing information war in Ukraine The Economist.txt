Just as with its land invasion, Russias initial online plans appear to have fallen short. The countrys use of offensive cyber tools has been irresponsible and indiscriminate.
Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britains GCHQ intelligence service said on Friday.
Without going into much detail, Fleming said the UKs National Cyber Force could respond to Russia by deploying a UK military unit that employs offensive cyber tools.
So far, president Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the West. Although thats cause for celebration, we should not underestimate how Russian disinformation is playing out elsewhere in the world, Fleming wrote.
He also said Russia has used the same playbook before on Syria and the Balkans and said online disinformation is a major part of Russias strategy. However, the GCHQ has been able to intercept and to provide warnings in time, he said.
Jeremy Fleming, the intelligence head, in an op-ed in The Economist, wrote that both countries have been using their cyber capabilities in the war in Ukraine.
