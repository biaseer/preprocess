You know what was absolutely incredible in Mariupol? Nobody was afraid of death, even though they thought they were. Death was already here and everyone wanted to die in a meaningful way. People helped each other even at the risk of their lives. They smoked outside and talked even when bombs were falling. Money no longer existed because life had become too short to think about it, reads the films presentation.
Mariupol 2, a documentary by the Lithuanian filmmaker Mantas Kvedaraviius who was killed in east Ukraine last month, will be screened at the 75th Cannes International Film Festival, the Lithuanian Film Centre said on Thursday.
According to the Lithuanian Film Centre, Mariupol 2 is a mosaic of everyday moments in a city at war.
