Once the video with a pre-recorded speech started, representatives of Western and like-minded countries stood up and walked out. They included Darius Staniulis, Lithuanias Permanent Representative to the United Nations and other International Organisations in Geneva.
Lavrovs speech was filled with blatant lies, including that Kyiv was responsible for the war in Ukraine and that it was trying to make nuclear weapons.
