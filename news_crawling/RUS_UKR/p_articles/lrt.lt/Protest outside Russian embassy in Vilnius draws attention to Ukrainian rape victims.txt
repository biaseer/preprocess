The event also included a fundraising campaign to buy contraceptive pills to be sent to Ukrainian rape victims.
Neringa Butkut, one of the protest organisers, said that protesters came to Vilnius from all over Lithuania.
The protest, similar to the one in Tallinn, was held to draw attention to girls and women raped by Russian soldiers and to press the Kremlin to end its aggression against Ukraine.
The protesters stood in silence for 20 minutes at a red-dyed pond outside the embassy.
Eighty women with bags over their heads, hands tied behind their backs, and bare legs smeared with fake blood protested outside the Russian embassy in Vilnius on Saturday to show solidarity with rape victims in Ukraine.
