Tensions in the region have soared as Russia sends troops to Ukraine's borders, including in Belarus. Lithuanian officials say they pose a direct threat to the country, with the United States readying to deploy additional forces to Eastern Europe in case of a further Russian attack against Ukraine.
Mobilisation involves preparing the countrys institutions for defence, as well as the procedures for receiving allied support. The plans also lay out the procedures for conscription.
This has been done, he said, refusing to provide more information. The details of these plans are not revealed, but the update has taken place, he added.
Mobilisation may be partial or full, and is announced by the parliament after first being proposed by the president.
Lithuania updated its mobilisation plans several weeks ago, Defence Minister Arvydas Anuauskas said on Wednesday.
