There are several open source reports of civilian ships being hit directly or indirectly as a result of the acts of war in the north-western Black Sea within Ukrainian territorial waters and adjacent international waters, NATO said. Civilian shipping is encouraged to exercise caution and be on high alert in the area.
All six crew members have since been safely accounted for, Estonian Public Broadcaster ERR quoted the Estonian foreign ministry as saying. None of the six were Estonian citizens, the ministry added.
Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, said the vessel might have struck a sea mine.
The Estonian-owned cargo ship Helt sank on Thursday off the Ukrainian port of Odessa after an explosion, Reuters has reported.
The Ukrainian Navy accused the Russians of forcing Helt to enter the dangerous zone of the Black Sea so that the occupiers can cover themselves with a civilian ship as a human shield, according to the New York Times.
NATO's Shipping Centre warned on Wednesday that there was a high risk of collateral damage on civilian shipping in the north-western part of the Black Sea, which included mines.
The Ukrainians said the Russians had threatened to fire on the ship if it did not comply: This is nothing but 21st-century piracy.
