Ukraine has previously accused Russia of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians from Mariupol. Russia is housing an estimated 5,000 at a temporary camp in Bezimenne, east of Mariupol, seen in satellite images, according to the BBC.
"There are some who were deported from Mariupol, but also other ones who left Crimea or Donbass themselves," he told the Estonian public broadcaster, ERR News, in a written comment.
Ukrainians deported from Mariupol are entering the Baltic states from Russia via Estonia, according to Eero Janson, head of the Estonian Refugee Council NGO.
Lux Express and other bus lines have also reported a high number of Ukrainian nationals among the passengers arriving from Russia, according to ERR News.
Additionally, people living in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia have also left the country and travelled through Russia, Janson said. "It's difficult to say any numbers," he added.
