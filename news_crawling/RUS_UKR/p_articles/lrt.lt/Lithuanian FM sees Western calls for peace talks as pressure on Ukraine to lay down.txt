French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this month that Russia and Ukraine would have to come to a negotiated truce and that peace efforts would not be served by Russia's "humiliation".
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, in response, routes for possible talks with the Kremlin "are littered with bodies".
"They will say when the war is over for them, how long they are going to continue fighting, what results need to be achieved, and what goals they are setting for themselves," Landsbergis said.
The conditions for ending the war "must be set in Ukraine", Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Tuesday.
"It seems to me that this is pressure on Ukraine to lay down arms or to stop attacking the occupying forces," he told BNS.
Landsbergis said this was his reaction "to the formulations of some Western leaders that perhaps the two sides have to declare a ceasefire and sit down at the negotiating table".
