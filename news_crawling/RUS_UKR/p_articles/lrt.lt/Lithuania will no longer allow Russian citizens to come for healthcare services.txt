Permits will only be issued in cases when a person wants to come to take care of close relatives living in Lithuania.
That means that foreigners from a hostile state will no longer be able to come to Lithuania for personal healthcare services, including diagnostics, hospital or surgical treatment, as well as medical rehabilitation services, the ministry said.
The Lithuanian health ministry has announced its decision to stop issuing permits for Russian citizens to come to Lithuania on an exceptional basis in response to Russias war in Ukraine.
After having amassed hundreds of thousands of troops near Ukraine's border over the past several months, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a military operation against the neighbouring country on Thursday.
