Saulius Abrakeviius, spokesman for Swedbank, one of the biggest commecial banks in the country, says there have been no major changes in the amount of money people withdraw from ATMs.
"We are monitoring the situation but we don't see any major increase. We have a lot of private clients, so all of that mass needs to make withdrawals for us to see any changes," he told BNS.
The central bank of Lithuania says more money is being withdrawn from ATMs in the country, likely in reaction to Russia launching a military operation against Ukraine on Thursday.
"As geopolitical tensions rise in the region, cash demand in Lithuania has increased slightly. We would like to underline, however, that money circulation in Lithuania is going smoothly. The Bank of Lithuania, credit institutions and money transportation companies are ready to respond to an increase in cash demand," the central bank told BNS without providing details on the scope of the increase in cash demand.
