President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian nuclear forces to be put on high alert amid the invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Putin said:Western countries arent only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading Nato members made aggressive statements regarding our country."
Ukraine's PresidentVolodymyr Zelensk initially suggested other locations, saying his country was unwilling to meet in Belarus because it served as a staging ground for the invasion.

Following its gains to the east in the city of Kharkiv and multiple ports, Russia sent a delegation to Belarus for peace talks with Ukraine, according to the Kremlin.
This means Mr Putin wants Russia's nuclear weapons prepared for readiness to launch after increased tensions between the East and West.
