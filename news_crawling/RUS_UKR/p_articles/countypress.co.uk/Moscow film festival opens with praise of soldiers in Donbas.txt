The 44th Moscow International Film Festival opened on Friday with reduced foreign representation amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Festival head Nikita Mikhalkov, the Academy Award-winning director of Burnt By The Sun, brushed that off, saying: It makes no difference how big are the stars that come.
Actually, a new world and a new society are being born there. The problem is that unfortunately not everybody understands that this is serious and its here to stay, he said.
We do not moderate comments, but we expect readers to adhere to certain rules in the interests of open and accountable debate.
The festival opened with the premiere of a widely anticipated Russian historical epic, Land Of Legends, directed by Anton Megerdichev.
These days, the heroes are in Donbas, he said, referring to eastern Ukraines industrial heartland, two regions that Russia recognised as sovereign this year after Russia-backed separatists began fighting the Ukrainian government there in 2014.
