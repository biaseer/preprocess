Chef Ollie and his team are also hoping to use their minibus to help transport refugees to safer parts of Poland, away from the border.
The burger chain is asking customers for any advice on how it can increase its impact, while staff are over there, to message via Facebook.
Staff from Hull's popular Dope Burger will head to the Ukraine border this weekend, to provide aid to those affected by the Russian invasion.
On a post on Facebook on Wednesday night, Dope Burger said: "We are heading to the Ukraine boarder this Saturday to help with the relief aid and hopefully provide some hot food to refugees crossing into Poland.
The public has shown lots of support to the popular chain since the post, and many have volunteered to help in the way of man power, or goods donations.
To get involved, or to offer any help to the company in their mission, you can find their page here.
"Please If anyone has any advice on optimising our impact on the ground while we are there DM us. Big love. Chef Ollie and the team."
Dope Burger has set up restaurants in Hull, Leeds and Doncaster, and is considered to serve some of the best burgers money can buy.
The company is hoping to do its bit in providing some hot meals for Ukrainians evacuating to Poland.
