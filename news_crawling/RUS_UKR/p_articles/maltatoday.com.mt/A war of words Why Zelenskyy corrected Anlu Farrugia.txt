In Russia, president Vladimir Putin has consistently referred to the war as a special military operation to protect people who have been subject to bullying and genocide for the last eight years.
In the Maltese parliament, Prime Minister Robert Abela shifted between conflict and war in his speech, while Opposition leader Bernard Grech more consistently used the term war.
And as recently as Monday, Putin continued to refer to the Russian invasion as a special military operation.
Months ago, reports surfaced of an internal United Nations email advising staff to refer to the invasion as a conflict or military offensive.
It is no wonder that Zelenskyy, a leader of a country that is trying to defend itself against Russias military might, took umbrage at the use of the word conflict.
Zelenskyy immediately called this out. He insisted that the conflict is indeed a war, and that there will be no playing along with the aggressor.

The invasion of Ukraine has been a war of words just as it has been one of military aggression.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was quick to correct parliamentary speaker Anglu Farrugia when he used the word conflict to describe the situation in Ukraine.
This wasnt the first time Zelenskyy found fault with the terminology used to describe the situation in his homeland.
The operation started on 24 February when Russian soldiers crossed the border into Ukraine and missiles rained down on cities across all of Ukraine.
We dont have a conflict, we have a war, he said, mere seconds into his address to the Maltese parliament.
