Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has admitted for the first time that the west's sanctions have created some problems and difficulties for Russia. However, he said they will be resolved.
Kuleba said that his country cannot stop the war if the country that started the aggression has no desire to do so. He said the list of Lavrov's demands is a surrender.
The International Committee of the Red Cross on Thursday warned that food and water supplies in Mariupol were running dangerously low.
The Russian leader said the west would have imposed sanctions against Russia no matter what and said his country will have increased independence and sovereignty in the long term.
But Kuleba said the broad narrative from Lavrov during their meeting was that Russia will continue its aggression until Ukraine meets their demands.
Kuleba said he is ready to meet with his counterpart Sergei Lavrov again if there are prospects for a substantial discussion.
Kuleba said the biggest problem facing his country is the situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol. The city has been shelled incessantly by Russian forces, which also bombed a maternity and childrens hospital on Wednesday.
No progress towards a ceasefire was registered in peace talks held in Turkey with Ukraines Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba saying Russias demands amounted to surrender.
