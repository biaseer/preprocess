By the end of this weekend, we shall have a much clearer picture of Putins conquest, is it to get to Ukraine and take Kyiv, or is it to get Kyiv as a base from which to launch further strikes into Europe? But know this, if Putin is really doing what it looks like hes doing, then it will be Israel that will be his final destination, not Ukraine. FROM THE DAILY MAIL UK: Stunned families watched in disbelief as the huge fireball mushroomed into the cold air after one of Putins missiles scored a direct hit. The facility was targeted in an effort to cut off fuel supplies to Ukraine forces desperately trying to hold back the Russian troops. It came just hours after Ukraines interior ministry warned Russian troops could target natural gas transit pipelines from Russia to Europe. The ministry called on Ukrainians to watch out for any people with Russian accents who suddenly arrived in their region. It said several saboteur groups has been discovered in Kyiv and warned that more were appearing in other cities. AND AS NIGHT FELL IN KYIV THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS OF MORE EXPLOSIONS AND STRIKES ON THE HORIZON AS DARKNESS BROUGHT NO RESPITE FOR THE COUNTRY. The daytime had seen bloody street-to-street fighting as Ukrainian troops tasked with the citys defence began setting up defensive positions across highways, on bridges and on street corners with gunfire and explosions heard in the centre of the capital. Civilians were also being armed with rifles and Molotov cocktails. Earlier one lone Ukrainian citizen was pictured standing up to Putins troops by trying to block a Russian military convoy  in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Squares tank man blocking Chinese forces in 1989. THE FOOTAGE, THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FILMED IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY CLOSE TO CRIMEA, EMERGED AS RUSSIAS MILITARY BARED DOWN ON KYIV TODAY IN AN APPARENT BID TO SEIZE THE CAPITAL AND DECAPITATE THE GOVERNMENT IN THE HOPES OF BRINGING A SWIFT VICTORY FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN. Russian forces were sustaining heavy casualties across the country with Ukraine claiming to have killed 2,800 men  as Putin himself made an appeal to Ukrainian forces to turn on their drug-addicted neo-Nazi leaders or else lay down their arms and go home. But there seemed little chance of that, as President Zelensky told his men you are all we have as he gave a rousing address to defend the country, called on citizens to travel from elsewhere in Europe to join the battle, and hit out at the West for leaving him to face down the might of Russia alone. Ukrainian troops were using armoured vehicles and snowploughs to defend Kyiv and limit movement, and said Russian spies were seeking to infiltrate the city. A truck was pictured riddled with bullets and bodies scattered around it, with Ukraine saying the men were Russian saboteurs dressed in Ukrainian uniforms that it had killed. Meanwhile Russias military said it had seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv in what would be a hammer blow to the defence. It is thought the plan is to use one of the citys airports to fly in tens of thousands of reinforcements. Ukrainian forces did not mention an airport being captured, but Zelensky said fighting had restarted around Gostomel  a key airport where battles raged throughout the day on Thursday. RUSSIA CLAIMED TO HAVE ALREADY CUT THE CITY OFF FROM THE WEST  THE DIRECTION MOST OF THOSE ESCAPING THE INVASION ARE HEADING IN  WITH LINES OF CARS SNAKING TOWARDS THE POLISH BORDER. Intense fire broke out on a bridge across the Dnieper River dividing the eastern and western sides of Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces establishing defensive positions and taking shelter behind their armoured vehicles and later under the bridge. The Russian troops are thought to have arrived from the north-west, having pushed down from Chernobyl which was captured late yesterday. More Russian troops and armour are advancing on the capital from Konotop, in the east, having bypassed the city of Chernihiv where they ran into heavy Ukrainian resistance. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraines interior minister, said today will be the wars hardest day.

On the podcast today, we shared with you Vladimir Putins spiritual secret that is driving him to conduct the largest military campaign in Europe since the end of World War II. Putin is following in the demonic footsteps of the previous European messiah Adolf Hitler. This weekend, Putin has vowed to take Ukraine capital Kyiv at any cost, and as you can see, that cost is a steep one to say the least. And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.

Because that makes so much more sense than Russia simply turning off the flow from safely inside Russia. No, lets send Force 10 from Navarone instead.
The huge difference between WWII and now is that Israel didnt exist. Now that it has for over 70 years plus, all bets are off on how much borrowed time you guys have.
The Ukraine skies lit up with fire tonight as Russian forces launched a devastating attack on one of the countrys fuel stores.

THE FOOTAGE, THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FILMED IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY CLOSE TO CRIMEA, EMERGED AS RUSSIAS MILITARY BARED DOWN ON KYIV TODAY IN AN APPARENT BID TO SEIZE THE CAPITAL AND DECAPITATE THE GOVERNMENT IN THE HOPES OF BRINGING A SWIFT VICTORY FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN. Russian forces were sustaining heavy casualties across the country with Ukraine claiming to have killed 2,800 men  as Putin himself made an appeal to Ukrainian forces to turn on their drug-addicted neo-Nazi leaders or else lay down their arms and go home. But there seemed little chance of that, as President Zelensky told his men you are all we have as he gave a rousing address to defend the country, called on citizens to travel from elsewhere in Europe to join the battle, and hit out at the West for leaving him to face down the might of Russia alone. Ukrainian troops were using armoured vehicles and snowploughs to defend Kyiv and limit movement, and said Russian spies were seeking to infiltrate the city. A truck was pictured riddled with bullets and bodies scattered around it, with Ukraine saying the men were Russian saboteurs dressed in Ukrainian uniforms that it had killed. Meanwhile Russias military said it had seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv in what would be a hammer blow to the defence. It is thought the plan is to use one of the citys airports to fly in tens of thousands of reinforcements. Ukrainian forces did not mention an airport being captured, but Zelensky said fighting had restarted around Gostomel  a key airport where battles raged throughout the day on Thursday. RUSSIA CLAIMED TO HAVE ALREADY CUT THE CITY OFF FROM THE WEST  THE DIRECTION MOST OF THOSE ESCAPING THE INVASION ARE HEADING IN  WITH LINES OF CARS SNAKING TOWARDS THE POLISH BORDER. Intense fire broke out on a bridge across the Dnieper River dividing the eastern and western sides of Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces establishing defensive positions and taking shelter behind their armoured vehicles and later under the bridge. The Russian troops are thought to have arrived from the north-west, having pushed down from Chernobyl which was captured late yesterday. More Russian troops and armour are advancing on the capital from Konotop, in the east, having bypassed the city of Chernihiv where they ran into heavy Ukrainian resistance. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraines interior minister, said today will be the wars hardest day.

It came just hours after Ukraines interior ministry warned Russian troops could target natural gas transit pipelines from Russia to Europe.
AND AS NIGHT FELL IN KYIV THERE WERE ALSO REPORTS OF MORE EXPLOSIONS AND STRIKES ON THE HORIZON AS DARKNESS BROUGHT NO RESPITE FOR THE COUNTRY. The daytime had seen bloody street-to-street fighting as Ukrainian troops tasked with the citys defence began setting up defensive positions across highways, on bridges and on street corners with gunfire and explosions heard in the centre of the capital. Civilians were also being armed with rifles and Molotov cocktails. Earlier one lone Ukrainian citizen was pictured standing up to Putins troops by trying to block a Russian military convoy  in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Squares tank man blocking Chinese forces in 1989.
