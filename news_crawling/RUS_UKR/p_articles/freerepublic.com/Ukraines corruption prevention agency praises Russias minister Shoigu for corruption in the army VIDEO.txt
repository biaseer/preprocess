Sorry, the NYT is unreadable and MSNBC is unwatchable. My thoughts on this are based on seeing what is being reported, recognizing and filtering out as much of the bias, spin and mediocre propaganda everyone is putting out as I can. Then trying to make sense of what is left over.
Special thanks also go to those that provide the Russian army with military food packages, the expiration date of which is due to 2015. Due to the lack of food, the Russian occupation troops abandon military equipment and surrender to the local residents of Ukrainian villages in order to eat.We also admired your bulletproof vests made of cardboard instead of the armored plates that were worn by the crew members of the captured Russian Barnaul-T armored car.Bulletproof vests were so strong that they were damaged by conventional small arms. In this regard, we express special gratitude, because now the armored car serves in the ranks of the Ukrainian defense forces and helps to resist the aggressor.We also want to draw your attention to the fact that our army found a bulletin named On the procedure for detecting corruption and other violations when identifying a conflict of interest in military units in place of the armored plates.Impressed by such a thorough and detailed methodological support for the military personnel of the occupying forces, the Agencys experts prepared a number of recommendations for further inclusion in the relevant bulletins. Thus, according to the generally accepted definition, a conflict of interest is the presence of private interest in the area in which a person performs hisher official or representative powers, which may affect the objectivity or impartiality of hisher decision-making.We see the risk that, despite the presence of mobile crematoria brought to the territory of Ukraine by the command of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the private interest of a Russian soldier to save his life instead of following the orders of his commander is still extremely high. In this regard, we propose to reduce the likelihood of a conflict of interest by supplementing the bulletins with the following step-by-step instructions: In case of crossing the border with Ukraine, a Russian serviceman is obliged to:  get to the nearest settlement  move away from the equipment at a safe distance and drop the weapon  ask for forgiveness for crossing the border without passport control  wait for the Ukrainian military, who will allow him to call his mother  wait for his return home.We look forward to fruitful cooperation in taking into account our recommendations.Attached to the letter of thanks, we send photos illustrating the above achievements. We are sending the letter now, while there is still foreign computer equipment in Russia that allows you to view the relevant photographs.Head of the Agency
In particular, the protection of Russian tanks T-72 and T-80 made from cardboard egg trays. Without a doubt, these means of protecting military equipment deserve to become a separate assessment factor in the PowerIndex when forming the Global Firepower rating of the strongest armies in the world.The Agency also expresses its deep gratitude to Mr. Shoigu for the use of ZIL-130 cars to transport personnel, which has no analogs in the world. While such cars are obviously comfortable to the Russian soldiers as they feel light dizziness during the Ukrainian March frosts, the speed of movement of this vehicle, as well as its bright aquamarine color, allow the local territorial defense forces to effectively undergo training in the operation of modern weapons against light targets.Special thanks also go to those that provide the Russian army with military food packages, the expiration date of which is due to 2015.

THANK YOU LETTERThe National Agency on Corruption Prevention hereinafter referred to as the Agency supports all representatives of foreign states who contribute to the development of Ukrainian anti-corruption bodies, as well as help in strengthening democratic institutions in Ukraine.In this regard, the Agency expresses its sincere gratitude to the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, Sergei Shoigu, for his invaluable contribution to the fact that Russian means and support resources for the attack on Ukraine were stolen even before they were accumulated on the border of the two states.Participating in the methodical, systematic, and long-term work on the theft of the budgetary funds of the Russian Federation, which were allocated for the development of military potential, Sergei Shoigu, together with other officials of the defense sector, contributed to the acceleration of the liquidation of the occupiers on the lands of the sovereign state of Ukraine.The persistence of officials from the Ministry of Defense and the armed forces of the Russian Federation to embezzle funds from Russian taxpayers that should have gone to the needs of the army makes it much easier to defend democratic Ukraine.Thanks to this, Ukrainian anti-corruption institutions, which work to ensure transparency in the use of public funds, counteract corruption, fraud, and economic crime, will be able to resume their activities as soon as possible instead of wasting time on destroying the occupiers on their land, as well as scrap metal brought to the territory of our state.The military and Ukrainian intelligence team document numerous examples of this undoubtedly important activity.In particular, the protection of Russian tanks T-72 and T-80 made from cardboard egg trays.

The Head of the National Agency on Corruption Prevention of Ukraine NACP Oleksandr Novikov sent a thank you letter to the Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu praising his efforts to ensure the high level of corruption in the Russian army. As particular examples of Shoigus efforts to disgrace the Russian army, the Head of the NACP names the following facts the Ukrainian army discovered during the war started by Russia on February 24, 2022:Case 1. Ukrainian army discovered that the protection of Russian tanks T-72 and T-80 was made from cardboard egg trays.Case 2. Bulletproof vests of Russian forces are made of cardboard instead of armored plates. Such bulletproof vests were worn by the crew members of the Russian Barnaul-T armored car captured by the Ukrainian army. Thanks to such powerful protection, now the armored car serves in the ranks of the Ukrainian defense forces and helps to resist the aggressor.Case 3. Russian army uses ZIL-130 to transfer its soldiers. The bright aquamarine color of the vehicle and the lack of coverage makes it an easy target even for the inexperienced weapon user.As the body responsible for identifying and preventing conflicts of interest, the NACP could not ignore the fact that cardboard bulletproof vests contained the bulletin named On the Procedure for Detecting Corruption and Other Violations of Conflict of Interest in Military Units.The NACP identified the risk that the private interest of a Russian soldier to save his life instead of following the orders of his commander is still extremely high.In this regard, the NACP proposed to reduce the likelihood of a conflict of interest by supplementing the bulletins with the following step-by-step instructions: In case of crossing the border with Ukraine, a Russian serviceman is obliged to:  get to the nearest settlement  move away from the equipment at a safe distance and drop the weapon  ask for forgiveness for crossing the border without passport control  wait for the Ukrainian military, who will allow him to call his mother  wait for his return home.The Head of NACP expressed hope for fruitful cooperation on the recommendations provided.He also noted that the letter was sent now because Russias Minister still has foreign computer equipment that allows him to view photos.See the full letter in Russian by the link and the original letter in Russian by the link.To paise Russian corruption in general, the NACP has also developed a video available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian.Minister of Defense of the Russian FederationSergei SHOIGUTHANK YOU LETTERThe National Agency on Corruption Prevention hereinafter referred to as the Agency supports all representatives of foreign states who contribute to the development of Ukrainian anti-corruption bodies, as well as help in strengthening democratic institutions in Ukraine.In this regard, the Agency expresses its sincere gratitude to the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, Sergei Shoigu, for his invaluable contribution to the fact that Russian means and support resources for the attack on Ukraine were stolen even before they were accumulated on the border of the two states.Participating in the methodical, systematic, and long-term work on the theft of the budgetary funds of the Russian Federation, which were allocated for the development of military potential, Sergei Shoigu, together with other officials of the defense sector, contributed to the acceleration of the liquidation of the occupiers on the lands of the sovereign state of Ukraine.The persistence of officials from the Ministry of Defense and the armed forces of the Russian Federation to embezzle funds from Russian taxpayers that should have gone to the needs of the army makes it much easier to defend democratic Ukraine.Thanks to this, Ukrainian anti-corruption institutions, which work to ensure transparency in the use of public funds, counteract corruption, fraud, and economic crime, will be able to resume their activities as soon as possible instead of wasting time on destroying the occupiers on their land, as well as scrap metal brought to the territory of our state.The military and Ukrainian intelligence team document numerous examples of this undoubtedly important activity.In particular, the protection of Russian tanks T-72 and T-80 made from cardboard egg trays.

Zlochevsky served as Ecology and Natural Resources Minister during most of the first cabinet of Mykola Azarov,1 and during both the later part of Azarovs first government and all of Azarovs second government, he served as deputy secretary on National Security and Defense Council NSDC of the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych.
Basically, the whole Burisma thing leads back to Putin. Zlochevsky fled Ukraine when Putins henchman, Yanukovich, fled to his master in Moscow.
What Russia says about its militry has small big problem know as "real life". I hope you weren't having a stroke when you wrote that. Hopefully you're just illiterate and write that way all the time.
I suspect the corruption in Russian military is serious. Will have to see how widespread it is, which wont be accurately assessed for now. I mean, is it ridiculous or mind-boggling?
Ridiculous, as in matching a Monty Python sketch, where the Russian mafia runs protection rackets on military bases, officers and soldiers.

While such cars are obviously comfortable to the Russian soldiers as they feel light dizziness during the Ukrainian March frosts, the speed of movement of this vehicle, as well as its bright aquamarine color, allow the local territorial defense forces to effectively undergo training in the operation of modern weapons against light targets.Special thanks also go to those that provide the Russian army with military food packages, the expiration date of which is due to 2015. Due to the lack of food, the Russian occupation troops abandon military equipment and surrender to the local residents of Ukrainian villages in order to eat.We also admired your bulletproof vests made of cardboard instead of the armored plates that were worn by the crew members of the captured Russian Barnaul-T armored car.Bulletproof vests were so strong that they were damaged by conventional small arms. In this regard, we express special gratitude, because now the armored car serves in the ranks of the Ukrainian defense forces and helps to resist the aggressor.We also want to draw your attention to the fact that our army found a bulletin named On the procedure for detecting corruption and other violations when identifying a conflict of interest in military units in place of the armored plates.Impressed by such a thorough and detailed methodological support for the military personnel of the occupying forces, the Agencys experts prepared a number of recommendations for further inclusion in the relevant bulletins. Thus, according to the generally accepted definition, a conflict of interest is the presence of private interest in the area in which a person performs hisher official or representative powers, which may affect the objectivity or impartiality of hisher decision-making.We see the risk that, despite the presence of mobile crematoria brought to the territory of Ukraine by the command of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the private interest of a Russian soldier to save his life instead of following the orders of his commander is still extremely high. In this regard, we propose to reduce the likelihood of a conflict of interest by supplementing the bulletins with the following step-by-step instructions: In case of crossing the border with Ukraine, a Russian serviceman is obliged to:  get to the nearest settlement  move away from the equipment at a safe distance and drop the weapon  ask for forgiveness for crossing the border without passport control  wait for the Ukrainian military, who will allow him to call his mother  wait for his return home.We look forward to fruitful cooperation in taking into account our recommendations.Attached to the letter of thanks, we send photos illustrating the above achievements. We are sending the letter now, while there is still foreign computer equipment in Russia that allows you to view the relevant photographs.Head of the Agency

As particular examples of Shoigus efforts to disgrace the Russian army, the Head of the NACP names the following facts the Ukrainian army discovered during the war started by Russia on February 24, 2022:Case 1. Ukrainian army discovered that the protection of Russian tanks T-72 and T-80 was made from cardboard egg trays.Case 2. Bulletproof vests of Russian forces are made of cardboard instead of armored plates. Such bulletproof vests were worn by the crew members of the Russian Barnaul-T armored car captured by the Ukrainian army. Thanks to such powerful protection, now the armored car serves in the ranks of the Ukrainian defense forces and helps to resist the aggressor.Case 3. Russian army uses ZIL-130 to transfer its soldiers. The bright aquamarine color of the vehicle and the lack of coverage makes it an easy target even for the inexperienced weapon user.As the body responsible for identifying and preventing conflicts of interest, the NACP could not ignore the fact that cardboard bulletproof vests contained the bulletin named On the Procedure for Detecting Corruption and Other Violations of Conflict of Interest in Military Units.The NACP identified the risk that the private interest of a Russian soldier to save his life instead of following the orders of his commander is still extremely high.In this regard, the NACP proposed to reduce the likelihood of a conflict of interest by supplementing the bulletins with the following step-by-step instructions: In case of crossing the border with Ukraine, a Russian serviceman is obliged to:  get to the nearest settlement  move away from the equipment at a safe distance and drop the weapon  ask for forgiveness for crossing the border without passport control  wait for the Ukrainian military, who will allow him to call his mother  wait for his return home.The Head of NACP expressed hope for fruitful cooperation on the recommendations provided.He also noted that the letter was sent now because Russias Minister still has foreign computer equipment that allows him to view photos.See the full letter in Russian by the link and the original letter in Russian by the link.To paise Russian corruption in general, the NACP has also developed a video available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian.Minister of Defense of the Russian FederationSergei SHOIGUTHANK YOU LETTERThe National Agency on Corruption Prevention hereinafter referred to as the Agency supports all representatives of foreign states who contribute to the development of Ukrainian anti-corruption bodies, as well as help in strengthening democratic institutions in Ukraine.In this regard, the Agency expresses its sincere gratitude to the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, Sergei Shoigu, for his invaluable contribution to the fact that Russian means and support resources for the attack on Ukraine were stolen even before they were accumulated on the border of the two states.Participating in the methodical, systematic, and long-term work on the theft of the budgetary funds of the Russian Federation, which were allocated for the development of military potential, Sergei Shoigu, together with other officials of the defense sector, contributed to the acceleration of the liquidation of the occupiers on the lands of the sovereign state of Ukraine.The persistence of officials from the Ministry of Defense and the armed forces of the Russian Federation to embezzle funds from Russian taxpayers that should have gone to the needs of the army makes it much easier to defend democratic Ukraine.Thanks to this, Ukrainian anti-corruption institutions, which work to ensure transparency in the use of public funds, counteract corruption, fraud, and economic crime, will be able to resume their activities as soon as possible instead of wasting time on destroying the occupiers on their land, as well as scrap metal brought to the territory of our state.The military and Ukrainian intelligence team document numerous examples of this undoubtedly important activity.In particular, the protection of Russian tanks T-72 and T-80 made from cardboard egg trays.

Oh well, caught again.  Me no spel gud somtims.  I thought my sarcasm was rather obvious. The point is, for all of how Russia promotes itself as a first rate military power, they are far from it. The invasion is making the flaws of the Russian military stand out far more than their capabilities.
The above is not a statement of fact. It is either opinion, or satire. Or both.
The Ukraine Agency on Corruption Prevention yeah, I know published this a week ago. Its too good to pass up. What Russia says about its militry has small big problem know as "real life". All the problems Russia is having is why Ukrainians and NATO are thinking there is a real chance the invasion will run out of gas - literally. No supplies, muntions, even food, and the invasion grinds to a halt.
How many sources have to report on the problems the Russian military has for them to be real? The Russian military's incompetence is Ukraine's greatest weapon. That is giving Ukraine hope they can hold out and outlast the invasion forces.

Without a doubt, these means of protecting military equipment deserve to become a separate assessment factor in the PowerIndex when forming the Global Firepower rating of the strongest armies in the world.The Agency also expresses its deep gratitude to Mr. Shoigu for the use of ZIL-130 cars to transport personnel, which has no analogs in the world. While such cars are obviously comfortable to the Russian soldiers as they feel light dizziness during the Ukrainian March frosts, the speed of movement of this vehicle, as well as its bright aquamarine color, allow the local territorial defense forces to effectively undergo training in the operation of modern weapons against light targets.Special thanks also go to those that provide the Russian army with military food packages, the expiration date of which is due to 2015. Due to the lack of food, the Russian occupation troops abandon military equipment and surrender to the local residents of Ukrainian villages in order to eat.We also admired your bulletproof vests made of cardboard instead of the armored plates that were worn by the crew members of the captured Russian Barnaul-T armored car.Bulletproof vests were so strong that they were damaged by conventional small arms. In this regard, we express special gratitude, because now the armored car serves in the ranks of the Ukrainian defense forces and helps to resist the aggressor.We also want to draw your attention to the fact that our army found a bulletin named On the procedure for detecting corruption and other violations when identifying a conflict of interest in military units in place of the armored plates.Impressed by such a thorough and detailed methodological support for the military personnel of the occupying forces, the Agencys experts prepared a number of recommendations for further inclusion in the relevant bulletins. Thus, according to the generally accepted definition, a conflict of interest is the presence of private interest in the area in which a person performs hisher official or representative powers, which may affect the objectivity or impartiality of hisher decision-making.We see the risk that, despite the presence of mobile crematoria brought to the territory of Ukraine by the command of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the private interest of a Russian soldier to save his life instead of following the orders of his commander is still extremely high. In this regard, we propose to reduce the likelihood of a conflict of interest by supplementing the bulletins with the following step-by-step instructions: In case of crossing the border with Ukraine, a Russian serviceman is obliged to:  get to the nearest settlement  move away from the equipment at a safe distance and drop the weapon  ask for forgiveness for crossing the border without passport control  wait for the Ukrainian military, who will allow him to call his mother  wait for his return home.We look forward to fruitful cooperation in taking into account our recommendations.Attached to the letter of thanks, we send photos illustrating the above achievements. We are sending the letter now, while there is still foreign computer equipment in Russia that allows you to view the relevant photographs.Head of the Agency
The skim off of supplies and equipment is unknown, but given the situation above, it can be assumed.

I thought my sarcasm was rather obvious. The point is, for all of how Russia promotes itself as a first rate military power, they are far from it. The invasion is making the flaws of the Russian military stand out far more than their capabilities.
