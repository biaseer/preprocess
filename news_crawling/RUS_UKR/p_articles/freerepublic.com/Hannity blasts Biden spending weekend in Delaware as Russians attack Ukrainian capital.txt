how does Hannity know de facto president Ron Klain is NOT in the White House???
Does it really matter where Joetato eats his pudding and has his butt wiped for him?
Hes not royalty, and hes grossly incompetent. No mercy. Mitchell Cask CaskMitchell February 26, 2022
He needs to build up those Amtrak frequent rider ponts so when AOC grounds all airplanes, he can vacay in Europe.
Well he has his fake WH set at his Delaware house so he could stay there quite a long time
Just a thought. If Biden gets medical care in Delaware, he is not getting it in DC. Not that Im suggesting anything.

He should not go homethe ship of state has no one at the helm. Who is in charge? In this case Hannity is right.
Hannity said the president needs to 'turn around' and go back to the White House

The further away Joe is from DC the better, I hope he extends his vacation.
White House said hes going to Delaware to attend a funeral memorial service for his daughter-in-laws mother. LIES. There is no funeral or memorial service this weekend.

As the President of the United States, Biden should be 247 at the White House, leading America in full support of the Ukrainian people and in full opposition to the Russian  .
Biden cant do anything about it anyway. He actually doesnt want to because this is scrubbing away evidence of what he and Hunter have done over there.
