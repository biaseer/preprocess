I suspect with drones and other modern tech it has gotten a lot easier to located and kill command and control centers
True. This dead general was a political appointee whose father helped murder over 22,000 Poles at Katyn back in 1940.
I have a lot more respect for a Sgt. Major, a Gunnery Sargent, a CPO, or a Senior master Sargent than any officer Colonel and above, why?
How many generals have taken a fast train out of town so far? Any statistics on that?
Keep up the body count and drive the invading Russian animals out of Ukraine! Good job boys!
Well see how you blood thirsty freaks cheer every death when it gets to you and yours. Because that is what you are advocating.
They might carry personal comm devices  I do NOT mean cellphones  that are intended to be secure, but maybe aint.
Darn!! I was hoping it would be Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov, the butcher of Syria, currently placed in command of Military Operations in Ukraine.
Russia confirms that Maj Gen Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of the 8th Army, was killed in combat in Ukraine.
