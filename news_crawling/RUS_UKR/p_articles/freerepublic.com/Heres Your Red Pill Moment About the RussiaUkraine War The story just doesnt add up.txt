Anytime anyone uses the term red pill I tune them out as quacks. BTW: The Matrix SUCKED!
It's time for your red pill. Something smells rotten in Ukraine. The story is rotten, rancid, hinky the story just doesn't add up. President Joe Biden and the media desperately want you to believe Russia is the bad guy and Ukraine is a little angel. They want you to fall in love with underdog Ukraine. They want you to support America getting involved on behalf of Ukraine. To get your support, they need the media to sell you a bill of goods. But it just doesn't add up. First, Biden is the one who funded Russia's invasion. Biden killed our pipelines, killed coal and banned drilling, which made us dependent on Russian oil  which made Russia filthy rich and arrogant. Biden paid for this war. Second, if Russian President Vladimir Putin is the "bad guy," if Russia is evil, why is Biden continuing to buy billions of dollars of oil from Russia every day? Does this make sense? Unless it's pure "commie theatre." Connect the dots. Biden is a feeble, feckless old puppet with dementia. George Soros pulls Biden's strings. Soros is on the side of Ukraine. Soros recently said the whole world must support Ukraine. It's been reported Soros funded Volodymyr Zelenskyy and then installed him as president of Ukraine  one of the most corrupt nations on the earth. Keep in mind, evil billionaire Soros is obsessed with hatred for America. He desperately wants to destroy our country. Soros has funded the invasion of our borders. He helps pay for illegal aliens many of them criminals, MS-13 gang members and murderers to enter America. Soros also funded and elected all the horrible, communist district attorneys across America. Soros' DAs are hellbent on destroying America. They have turned our big cities into killing zones where murderers run free without even posting bail while law-abiding citizens are stripped of guns and persecuted for defending themselves. Soros has paid for the destruction of America. Soros is one of the most evil enemies in our history. If Soros funded the leaders of Ukraine and put them in power, this has to be a trap. Ukraine must be a "bad guy." Now we come to the mainstream fake news media. Has the media ever told the truth in the seven years since former President Donald Trump came down that escalator? It's been nonstop lies, fraud and propaganda. The media tells you any lie that advances the cause of Democrats, Soros and the destruction of America. Now after seven years of lies and propaganda, suddenly you trust the media? You believe this one time they're telling the truth? This one time they have America's best interests at heart? Even though pure coincidence Soros is on the same side as the media. They're all one big happy family on the side of Ukraine. I'll tell what I think. No. 1: I think this war is a WMD: a weapon of mass distraction to get your mind off the disasters Biden has created at home, including open borders, massive inflation, vaccine mandates crippling the economy, the worst crime wave in history, the worst retreat in U.S. military history from Afghanistan and $6-per-gallon gas. No. 2: This is pure "wag-the-dog" theater to save Biden from the worst polls in modern history. Instead of hating Biden, they want you to hate Putin. No. 3: This is all part of Soros and Klaus Schwab's "Great Reset." They want to make us all obedient serfs and slaves. They need World War III as a distraction while they destroy America and capitalism and take your freedoms away. Here's my conclusion. I'm not "for" Russia. I'll never be a fan of Putin. He's out for only himself and a new dominant Russian empire. I'm not telling you to take Russia's side. They are "bad guys." But I know if Soros is behind Ukraine, then Ukraine is also a "bad guy." If Soros wants us involved, I know this war is not in America's best interest. I know the media is feeding us a load of lies and propaganda  under Soros' direction. Like Trump, I have only one dog in this hunt. I'm ONLY for "America First." This war is nonsense. It doesn't involve us. We should not be sending billions of dollars in aid or sending billions in military weapons to Ukraine. I don't want this to turn into WWIII. I don't want my kids or your kids dying over Ukraine. We need to stay a million miles away from this conflict. This isn't war, it's commie theater. It's a WMD: weapon of mass distraction. Don't believe a thing you read or see coming from the fake news media. Take your red pill and just say "NO" to this wag-the-dog moment.
Speaking of intellectually gullible, anyone who thinks that Putin is going to do any such thing is just that. Why would he? Hes already justified this invasion with reasons that make no mention of any bio labs, so theres no need for him to do so. He would be a fool to give up such valuable blackmail material. Sorry to tell everyone, but Putin is not a knight in shining armor about to rescue everyone from the New World Order.
Encourage and fund our liberals  Antifa to move to Canada.  Conservative Canadians can move here!
On Monday, Moscow claimed Ukrainian authorities had been destroying pathogens studied at 30 US-financed biolabs in the country. Kiev has denied developing bioweapons.
I have been saying these same things to everyone for the past couple of weeks and been shouted down and accused of working for Putin each and every day. It is amazing to me how all of our pro-vax Covid experts overnight turned into pro-Biden foreign policy experts. Biden and the Democrats approval ratings have now taken a sharp upward turn. The midterms may not be such a bloodbath for them after all. All because this war has given them something to rally around. Anyone who doesnt believe this is 99 political theater has their eyes closed and their ears plugged with manure.
But I know if Soros is behind Ukraine, then Ukraine is also a "bad guy." If Soros wants us involved, I know this war is not in America's best interest. I know the media is feeding us a load of lies and propaganda  under Soros' direction. Like Trump, I have only one dog in this hunt. I'm ONLY for "America First." This war is nonsense.

The response came in regards to a question from Senator Marco Rubio, who asked: Does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons? Following Nulands response, Rubio continued on to ask whether she would have any doubt that the Russians would be behind any potential biological or chemical attacks. Im sure youre aware that the Russian propaganda, two groups already putting out there all kinds of information about how theyve uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in the country and with NATOs coordination. If theres a biological or chemical weapon incident or or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100 percent it would be the Russians that would be behind it? Rubio asked.
There is no doubt in my mind, Senator, and it is classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy what theyre planning to do themselves, Nuland responded.

On Tuesday, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate that the US is working with Ukraine to protect biological research labs as Russia continues its attacks on the Eastern European nation.
 2022 - VOTE THE BUMS  OUT  ALL OF THEM! RE-ELECT NO ONE!!
Irritating people are the grit from which we fashion our pearl. I provide the grit. You're Welcome.
Ive said it before the only good guys in this fight, are the Ukrainian people, who are being sacrificed for this wag the dog operation. Putin is evil, but so is the Ukrainian government unfortunately, our present government is just as evil.
Second, if Russian President Vladimir Putin is the "bad guy," if Russia is evil, why is Biden continuing to buy billions of dollars of oil from Russia every day? Does this make sense?

A little loosly written. But as a distraction for the media thats working. Whether it distracts America from their Biden implemented problems, Im skeptical.

To get your support, they need the media to sell you a bill of goods. But it just doesn't add up. First, Biden is the one who funded Russia's invasion.

They have turned our big cities into killing zones where murderers run free without even posting bail while law-abiding citizens are stripped of guns and persecuted for defending themselves. Soros has paid for the destruction of America. Soros is one of the most evil enemies in our history. If Soros funded the leaders of Ukraine and put them in power, this has to be a trap. Ukraine must be a "bad guy." Now we come to the mainstream fake news media. Has the media ever told the truth in the seven years since former President Donald Trump came down that escalator? It's been nonstop lies, fraud and propaganda. The media tells you any lie that advances the cause of Democrats, Soros and the destruction of America. Now after seven years of lies and propaganda, suddenly you trust the media? You believe this one time they're telling the truth? This one time they have America's best interests at heart? Even though pure coincidence Soros is on the same side as the media. They're all one big happy family on the side of Ukraine. I'll tell what I think. No. 1: I think this war is a WMD: a weapon of mass distraction to get your mind off the disasters Biden has created at home, including open borders, massive inflation, vaccine mandates crippling the economy, the worst crime wave in history, the worst retreat in U.S. military history from Afghanistan and $6-per-gallon gas. No. 2: This is pure "wag-the-dog" theater to save Biden from the worst polls in modern history. Instead of hating Biden, they want you to hate Putin. No. 3: This is all part of Soros and Klaus Schwab's "Great Reset." They want to make us all obedient serfs and slaves. They need World War III as a distraction while they destroy America and capitalism and take your freedoms away. Here's my conclusion. I'm not "for" Russia. I'll never be a fan of Putin. He's out for only himself and a new dominant Russian empire. I'm not telling you to take Russia's side. They are "bad guys." But I know if Soros is behind Ukraine, then Ukraine is also a "bad guy." If Soros wants us involved, I know this war is not in America's best interest. I know the media is feeding us a load of lies and propaganda  under Soros' direction. Like Trump, I have only one dog in this hunt. I'm ONLY for "America First." This war is nonsense. It doesn't involve us. We should not be sending billions of dollars in aid or sending billions in military weapons to Ukraine. I don't want this to turn into WWIII. I don't want my kids or your kids dying over Ukraine. We need to stay a million miles away from this conflict. This isn't war, it's commie theater. It's a WMD: weapon of mass distraction. Don't believe a thing you read or see coming from the fake news media. Take your red pill and just say "NO" to this wag-the-dog moment.
This one I have saved and forwarded to several friends. This was in Townhall last week. It does cause you to stop and recalibrate your thinking. When was the last time you were in the side of George Soros? Are you on his side now? Just think about it.
Ive said this from the beginning, but the intellectually gullible on this forum that a few weeks ago called our media corrupt and now buy everything they say about this war with no proof, called the me and a few like minded that could see through this,, Putin supporters. Its all Jedi mind tricks on the weak minded! Biden is slime. Once Putin reveals how he destroyed over a dozen USCIA bio-labs on his border, all of this will prove us right!
The problem with that belief is the Ukrainian government staying to fight. In most cases like this the endgame is a planeful of cash and valuables and a flight into extravagant exile. See Afghanistan for a recent example. Unless Zelensky figures he is a dead man wherever he flees to like Stalin having Trotsky killed or more recent examples of Putin's enemies dying no matter where they hid, I would have expected him to have already fled unless he does see himself as a Ukrainian Churchill or Washington.

Unless it's pure "commie theatre." Connect the dots. Biden is a feeble, feckless old puppet with dementia. George Soros pulls Biden's strings. Soros is on the side of Ukraine. Soros recently said the whole world must support Ukraine. It's been reported Soros funded Volodymyr Zelenskyy and then installed him as president of Ukraine  one of the most corrupt nations on the earth. Keep in mind, evil billionaire Soros is obsessed with hatred for America. He desperately wants to destroy our country. Soros has funded the invasion of our borders. He helps pay for illegal aliens many of them criminals, MS-13 gang members and murderers to enter America. Soros also funded and elected all the horrible, communist district attorneys across America. Soros' DAs are hellbent on destroying America.

Victoria Nuland was forced to finally admit that the labs in Ukraine did indeed exist. https:www.opindia.com202203usa-admits-biolabs-in-ukraine-says-biological-attack-russias-fault. Little Marco Rubio tried to cover it up saying that if it happened, Russia would be behind it, after she accidentally let the cat out of the bag. I mentioned this was the main reason for Putin going in and I was ridiculed as a Putin cheerleader

FM spox Zhao Lijian claimed Tuesday that Beijing believes the laboratories in Ukraine are just the tip of an iceberg and that the US Dept of Defense controls 336 biological laboratories in 30 countries around the world.
Your link does not say that the United States was paying for the development andor production of biological weapons. The link says that the labs has samples of biological materials in order to detect and report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens.

Zhao also said that according to data released by the United States itself, there are 26 US laboratories in Ukraine. He urged all parties concerned to ensure the safety of the labs in light of Russias military offensive.

Once Putin reveals how he destroyed over a dozen USCIA bio-labs on his border, all of this will prove us right!
Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach, Nuland told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a hearing.
Putin is evil, but so is the Ukrainian government unfortunately, our present government is just as evil. The problem with that belief is the Ukrainian government staying to fight. In most cases like this the endgame is a planeful of cash and valuables and a flight into extravagant exile. See Afghanistan for a recent example. Unless Zelensky figures he is a dead man wherever he flees to like Stalin having Trotsky killed or more recent examples of Putin's enemies dying no matter where they hid, I would have expected him to have already fled unless he does see himself as a Ukrainian Churchill or Washington.
If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favourable reference of the Devil...-Churchill
