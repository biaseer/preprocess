The Russian soldiers crossed their border illegally. Give them citizenship and enlist them in the Ukrainian army and make them fight for Ukraine.  Hey, why not?
hmm, the ukranians could end this by taxing the russians for being on their land- dont taxes solve everything?
LONDON, March 21 Reuters - Local officials in Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine have set up collection points where citizens can drop off donations of socks, medicine and tinned food for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine, according to messages from the officials seen by Reuters.
Along with the Russians dont have air for their tires, Russians dont have gasoline., Russians suffer from acute self-loathing, Russians are having an existential moral crisis....it really never seems to end.
Vlad reduced to begging like a pauper to provide for his troops. What an international laughing stock.
Clearly a scam - the mighty Russian army will be done taking care of business and back home before the month is out.
Nothing very relevant Tori in the story, our own American military does the same thing with care packages and volunteers.
Ya just cant get any more authoritative than second hand claims from anonymous sources via Reuters!
Then all they have to do is get them across the border and to the various troop locations - without anyone stealing any of it and selling it for vodka or a retirement fund
