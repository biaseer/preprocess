Recently China began approving imports of Russian wheat that had long been blocked because of Beijings concerns over fungus and other contaminants.
China could determine how high prices go. According to The New York Times:The effects on global grain prices will partly hinge on what China decides to do, the analysts said. China imports massive amounts of corn, barley and sorghum for animal feed from world markets. It could choose to buy those commodities, as well as wheat, from Russia instead of other countries. In such a situation, the impact of sanctions on global grain markets would be relatively small, they said.Recently China began approving imports of Russian wheat that had long been blocked because of Beijings concerns over fungus and other contaminants.Bottom line: This is bad news for the rest of the world because an alliance between China and Russia could have significant impacts on global security issues.Michael Carris the editor of True Options Masters, One Trade,Peak Velocity Traderand Precision Profits.

The Media reported the same thing about Russia during the Cold War. It was a lie, and I assume this is also a lie. Pretty sure China doesnt have enough food, not too much.
For China, this is especially good news now with the war threatening global supply. Russia and Ukraine together account for about 29 of global wheat exports.Its also good news for China since the countrys agriculture minister reported that the condition of Chinas winter wheat crop could be the worst in history.What This Means for ConsumersThis is all bad news for consumers in the rest of the world.Wheat prices have surged to 14-year highs after rising more than 50 in the past month. Wheat was already trending higher when the war started, and the current situation dampens supply even more.China could determine how high prices go.

They also recently bought a lot of USA farmland. So did Bill Gates. I think hes the owner of the largest amount of farmland in the US.
Earlier this week, I wrote about how China was better prepared than Russia to withstand economic sanctions. The chart below shows that preparation extends to foodstuffs as well.China Is Well-StockedIn the first half of crop year 2022, China has accumulated about 69 of the globes maize reserves, 60 of its rice and 51 of its wheat. A Chinese government official estimates that the wheat stocks on hand are enough to meet about 18 months of demand.For China, this is especially good news now with the war threatening global supply.

China also has accumulated a record number of grain eating rats, and bugs not to mention grain molds. Chinas food storage is much like its apartment construction : cheap and little regard for anything other that immediate profits.
On the other hand, it seems like China has been preparing for this action for years.But its more likely that China has strategic plans for any contingency.Earlier this week, I wrote about how China was better prepared than Russia to withstand economic sanctions.

That might be hard to believe since the military buildup had been underway for months.

Rather than encouraging stockpiling our government pays farmers to destroy crops. Todays leaders are the enemies of the people.

The Chinese are the ultimate realists. They do not indulge in green fantasies. They also know that green lunacy has caused the dismantling of the fossil fuel industry, increased the cost and made more scarce natural gas which is the core of fertilizer. Fertilizer is more expensive and less available. Worldwide crop yields are down. Famine is horrible. China is protecting itself. The lunatics are causing famine and will kill many.
