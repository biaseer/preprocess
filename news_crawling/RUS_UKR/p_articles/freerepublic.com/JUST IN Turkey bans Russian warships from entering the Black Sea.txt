God only knows whats going on behind closed doors in governments all over the world.
Were any ships bombed last week? No. Something has changed. Now what could that be? Apparently, bombing neutral ships is part Putinist Russia self defense. Chin up, buttercup.
According to this, they back tracked on that, just like Zelenskyy apparently back tracked on meeting with the Russians.
Turkey says it cannot stop the passage of warships through its straits following request from Ukraine
Besides Turkey isnt gonna piss off russia right now, they are trying to broker a ceasefire between russia and ukraine since they have close relations with both
Turkey, a NATO member, wont block access to the Black Sea by cutting off an international strait. It is an act of war. It risks a military confrontation with Russia.
When I was a kid was confused by the term chickenhawk. So I looked it up and found out it was a Vietnam war epiphtet spit at patriots by America hating and USSR supporting Democrats.
Go on any flight radar, weve had a global hawk circling just off the southern shores of Crimea for awhile. Its unusual for this to show up, is it to alert commercial traffic? Thats already avoiding the area anyway Or are we daring Putin to try something?
The intersection between modern neo isolationists on the right and Marxist Democrats is quite amusing to me. Birds of a feather flock together I guess.
Ok chickenhawk, I dont see you grabbing a gun and going over there to fight

This is because Russia has been attacking shipping. Including at least one NATO country flagged commercial vessel. Things were spinning out of control so Turkey must put Putinist Russia on a leash there.
