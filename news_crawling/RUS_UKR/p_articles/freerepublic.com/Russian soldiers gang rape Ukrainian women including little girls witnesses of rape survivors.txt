Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs.

Our source at a law enforcement agency told Euromaidan Press that as of 22 March there were nearly one hundred registered cases of rape by Russian soldiers, with many more unregistered cases. The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape. Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service. Some Russian soldiers have even boasted about their deeds,Ukraines Deputy Internal Minister said on 23 March.

Photo by mpalinchak russiawarcrimes.jpeg Testimonies of rape survivors Two Russians killed Nataliyas husband and repeatedly raped her On March 22, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced the first case of repeated rape by a Russian serviceman:  A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so.

Media 101. Its Africa, who gives a rats ass. Unless whitey is involved as bad guy South Africaor good guy Libya All this focus on Ukrainians. Whats a poor guy hacked to death in central africa to do. What was 8000 a day to clinton. Couldnt care less.
Sounds like a novel instead of a news story. Even if it was totally true, what do you expect us to do about it? Im sure the radical far-right neo-Nazi arm of the Ukrainian Army is guilty of the same crimes. Thats the nature of war.
Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service. Some Russian soldiers have even boasted about their deeds,Ukraines Deputy Internal Minister said on 23 March. Russian soldiers rape and kill Dead civilians are seen near a highway 20 km outside of Kyiv. Under the blanket are 4-5 dead naked women whom Russians tried to burn right there on the side of the road. Photo by mpalinchak russiawarcrimes.jpeg Testimonies of rape survivors Two Russians killed Nataliyas husband and repeatedly raped her On March 22, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced the first case of repeated rape by a Russian serviceman:  A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them.

He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko.

Officials and human rights organizations report rape Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a briefing at Londons Chatham House: We have numerous cases unfortunately where Russian soldiers have raped women in Ukrainian towns. The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in an answer to Ukrayinska Pravdas public request said on 18 March that they have been receiving complaints from Ukrainians about sexual crimes committed by the Russian military since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Our source at a law enforcement agency told Euromaidan Press that as of 22 March there were nearly one hundred registered cases of rape by Russian soldiers, with many more unregistered cases. The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape. Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service.

The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times.

On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal.

A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night.

She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said.

The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote.

The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed.

First raid Ukrainian liquor cabinets. Then rape as a group. They are too cowardly to rape women on their own. The Ukrainian woman would slap the shit out of him.
Editors Note Russian soldiers gang rape Ukrainian women threatening them with guns and knives in front of their children. One Russian rapist cut his victims cheek, another killed a womans husband, and another one killed the victims mother. Among the most monstrous cases is the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl by 11 Russian soldiers. Officials and human rights organizations report rape Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a briefing at Londons Chatham House: We have numerous cases unfortunately where Russian soldiers have raped women in Ukrainian towns. The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in an answer to Ukrayinska Pravdas public request said on 18 March that they have been receiving complaints from Ukrainians about sexual crimes committed by the Russian military since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Our source at a law enforcement agency told Euromaidan Press that as of 22 March there were nearly one hundred registered cases of rape by Russian soldiers, with many more unregistered cases. The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape. Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service. Some Russian soldiers have even boasted about their deeds,Ukraines Deputy Internal Minister said on 23 March. Russian soldiers rape and kill Dead civilians are seen near a highway 20 km outside of Kyiv. Under the blanket are 4-5 dead naked women whom Russians tried to burn right there on the side of the road. Photo by mpalinchak russiawarcrimes.jpeg Testimonies of rape survivors Two Russians killed Nataliyas husband and repeatedly raped her On March 22, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced the first case of repeated rape by a Russian serviceman:  A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed.

The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko.

Children. The children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with it and is it worth living at all. How to explain it to yourself? How? Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova confirmed on 5 April that in Irpin murdered children under the age of 10 with signs of rape and torture had been found. On 4 April, a journalist from local public broadcaster TV UA:Rivne reported about a 9-year-old girl from Irpin raped by 11 Russian soldiers who carved the letter Z on the little girls chest and murdered her:  It happened about two weeks ago. I only found out about it now. I was not a witness. The story is based exclusively on the words of my relative. My relative had a miscarriage because she learned about the fate of her close family, who could not evacuate from Irpin.  Parents were shot by rushists. Most likely, their nine-year-old daughter saw it. The little one was raped by ELEVEN, I cant find a word to say who. Apparently, the Ukrainian language does not have such a word. At least the examination showed that there were 11 different samples of semen on the girls body. According to my relative, the child did not have genitals  non-humans tore it.  They did not stop there. They carved the letter Z on Angels chest and ripped open her tummyAre you saying that Putin is to blame for everything? But it was not Putin who did it! All of Russia must answer for this.the journalist wrote. Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.
The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep.

I decided to eat an English muffin first. This carnage makes it hard to just fall asleep for me.
The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck.

Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother.

The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous.

Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.
Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed.

20220407 - 18:34  More, Russian Aggression Editors Note Russian soldiers gang rape Ukrainian women threatening them with guns and knives in front of their children. One Russian rapist cut his victims cheek, another killed a womans husband, and another one killed the victims mother. Among the most monstrous cases is the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl by 11 Russian soldiers. Officials and human rights organizations report rape Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a briefing at Londons Chatham House: We have numerous cases unfortunately where Russian soldiers have raped women in Ukrainian towns. The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in an answer to Ukrayinska Pravdas public request said on 18 March that they have been receiving complaints from Ukrainians about sexual crimes committed by the Russian military since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Our source at a law enforcement agency told Euromaidan Press that as of 22 March there were nearly one hundred registered cases of rape by Russian soldiers, with many more unregistered cases. The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape. Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service. Some Russian soldiers have even boasted about their deeds,Ukraines Deputy Internal Minister said on 23 March. Russian soldiers rape and kill Dead civilians are seen near a highway 20 km outside of Kyiv. Under the blanket are 4-5 dead naked women whom Russians tried to burn right there on the side of the road. Photo by mpalinchak russiawarcrimes.jpeg Testimonies of rape survivors Two Russians killed Nataliyas husband and repeatedly raped her On March 22, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced the first case of repeated rape by a Russian serviceman:  A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko.

The editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian media outlet Babel wrote about juvenile rape committed by Russian soldiers:Russian soldiers gang rape Ukrainian women, including little girls: witnesses of rape survivors   Some of the children killed have their hands tied. Children. The children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with it and is it worth living at all. How to explain it to yourself? How? Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova confirmed on 5 April that in Irpin murdered children under the age of 10 with signs of rape and torture had been found. On 4 April, a journalist from local public broadcaster TV UA:Rivne reported about a 9-year-old girl from Irpin raped by 11 Russian soldiers who carved the letter Z on the little girls chest and murdered her:  It happened about two weeks ago. I only found out about it now. I was not a witness. The story is based exclusively on the words of my relative. My relative had a miscarriage because she learned about the fate of her close family, who could not evacuate from Irpin.  Parents were shot by rushists. Most likely, their nine-year-old daughter saw it. The little one was raped by ELEVEN, I cant find a word to say who. Apparently, the Ukrainian language does not have such a word. At least the examination showed that there were 11 different samples of semen on the girls body. According to my relative, the child did not have genitals  non-humans tore it.  They did not stop there. They carved the letter Z on Angels chest and ripped open her tummyAre you saying that Putin is to blame for everything? But it was not Putin who did it! All of Russia must answer for this.the journalist wrote. Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.

Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide!

Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.
She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed.

No. If you go to site, you will find more articles including history of Russian military including disgusting WWII cartoon???. I posted this article as full investigations are being taken by multiple agencies. Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a briefing at Londons Chatham House.
Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them.

Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office.

One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

Are Ukrainians allegedly still shooting to wound, or castrating captured Russians? Ive seen a couple of those stories over the past month.
A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her.

The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous.

The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers.

All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko. A raped and murdered woman, and her murdered child in Ukraine, 2022 from the Series They can repeat Witnesses about Russian soldiers raping little girls Russian atrocities became appallingly apparent after Kyiv Oblast was liberated. The editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian media outlet Babel wrote about juvenile rape committed by Russian soldiers:Russian soldiers gang rape Ukrainian women, including little girls: witnesses of rape survivors   Some of the children killed have their hands tied. Children. The children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with it and is it worth living at all. How to explain it to yourself? How? Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova confirmed on 5 April that in Irpin murdered children under the age of 10 with signs of rape and torture had been found. On 4 April, a journalist from local public broadcaster TV UA:Rivne reported about a 9-year-old girl from Irpin raped by 11 Russian soldiers who carved the letter Z on the little girls chest and murdered her:  It happened about two weeks ago. I only found out about it now. I was not a witness. The story is based exclusively on the words of my relative. My relative had a miscarriage because she learned about the fate of her close family, who could not evacuate from Irpin.  Parents were shot by rushists. Most likely, their nine-year-old daughter saw it. The little one was raped by ELEVEN, I cant find a word to say who. Apparently, the Ukrainian language does not have such a word. At least the examination showed that there were 11 different samples of semen on the girls body. According to my relative, the child did not have genitals  non-humans tore it.  They did not stop there. They carved the letter Z on Angels chest and ripped open her tummyAre you saying that Putin is to blame for everything? But it was not Putin who did it! All of Russia must answer for this.the journalist wrote. Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.

My relative had a miscarriage because she learned about the fate of her close family, who could not evacuate from Irpin.  Parents were shot by rushists. Most likely, their nine-year-old daughter saw it. The little one was raped by ELEVEN, I cant find a word to say who. Apparently, the Ukrainian language does not have such a word. At least the examination showed that there were 11 different samples of semen on the girls body. According to my relative, the child did not have genitals  non-humans tore it.  They did not stop there. They carved the letter Z on Angels chest and ripped open her tummyAre you saying that Putin is to blame for everything? But it was not Putin who did it! All of Russia must answer for this.the journalist wrote. Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.

After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko.

Officials and human rights organizations report rape Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a briefing at Londons Chatham House: We have numerous cases unfortunately where Russian soldiers have raped women in Ukrainian towns. The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in an answer to Ukrayinska Pravdas public request said on 18 March that they have been receiving complaints from Ukrainians about sexual crimes committed by the Russian military since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Our source at a law enforcement agency told Euromaidan Press that as of 22 March there were nearly one hundred registered cases of rape by Russian soldiers, with many more unregistered cases. The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape. Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service. Some Russian soldiers have even boasted about their deeds,Ukraines Deputy Internal Minister said on 23 March.

Photo by mpalinchak russiawarcrimes.jpeg Testimonies of rape survivors Two Russians killed Nataliyas husband and repeatedly raped her On March 22, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced the first case of repeated rape by a Russian serviceman:  A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him.

And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed.

Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide!

The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.
We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape. Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service. Some Russian soldiers have even boasted about their deeds,Ukraines Deputy Internal Minister said on 23 March. Russian soldiers rape and kill Dead civilians are seen near a highway 20 km outside of Kyiv. Under the blanket are 4-5 dead naked women whom Russians tried to burn right there on the side of the road.

Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko. A raped and murdered woman, and her murdered child in Ukraine, 2022 from the Series They can repeat Witnesses about Russian soldiers raping little girls Russian atrocities became appallingly apparent after Kyiv Oblast was liberated. The editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian media outlet Babel wrote about juvenile rape committed by Russian soldiers:Russian soldiers gang rape Ukrainian women, including little girls: witnesses of rape survivors   Some of the children killed have their hands tied. Children. The children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with it and is it worth living at all. How to explain it to yourself? How? Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova confirmed on 5 April that in Irpin murdered children under the age of 10 with signs of rape and torture had been found. On 4 April, a journalist from local public broadcaster TV UA:Rivne reported about a 9-year-old girl from Irpin raped by 11 Russian soldiers who carved the letter Z on the little girls chest and murdered her:  It happened about two weeks ago. I only found out about it now. I was not a witness. The story is based exclusively on the words of my relative. My relative had a miscarriage because she learned about the fate of her close family, who could not evacuate from Irpin.  Parents were shot by rushists. Most likely, their nine-year-old daughter saw it. The little one was raped by ELEVEN, I cant find a word to say who. Apparently, the Ukrainian language does not have such a word. At least the examination showed that there were 11 different samples of semen on the girls body. According to my relative, the child did not have genitals  non-humans tore it.  They did not stop there. They carved the letter Z on Angels chest and ripped open her tummyAre you saying that Putin is to blame for everything? But it was not Putin who did it! All of Russia must answer for this.the journalist wrote. Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.

This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.

Source 20220407 - 18:34  More, Russian Aggression Editors Note Russian soldiers gang rape Ukrainian women threatening them with guns and knives in front of their children. One Russian rapist cut his victims cheek, another killed a womans husband, and another one killed the victims mother. Among the most monstrous cases is the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl by 11 Russian soldiers. Officials and human rights organizations report rape Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a briefing at Londons Chatham House: We have numerous cases unfortunately where Russian soldiers have raped women in Ukrainian towns. The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in an answer to Ukrayinska Pravdas public request said on 18 March that they have been receiving complaints from Ukrainians about sexual crimes committed by the Russian military since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Our source at a law enforcement agency told Euromaidan Press that as of 22 March there were nearly one hundred registered cases of rape by Russian soldiers, with many more unregistered cases. The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape. Cases of rape by Russian soldiers, in particular of young girls, have also become known via Russian occupiers conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian Security Service. Some Russian soldiers have even boasted about their deeds,Ukraines Deputy Internal Minister said on 23 March.

Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death.

For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko. A raped and murdered woman, and her murdered child in Ukraine, 2022 from the Series They can repeat Witnesses about Russian soldiers raping little girls Russian atrocities became appallingly apparent after Kyiv Oblast was liberated. The editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian media outlet Babel wrote about juvenile rape committed by Russian soldiers:Russian soldiers gang rape Ukrainian women, including little girls: witnesses of rape survivors   Some of the children killed have their hands tied. Children. The children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with it and is it worth living at all. How to explain it to yourself? How? Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova confirmed on 5 April that in Irpin murdered children under the age of 10 with signs of rape and torture had been found. On 4 April, a journalist from local public broadcaster TV UA:Rivne reported about a 9-year-old girl from Irpin raped by 11 Russian soldiers who carved the letter Z on the little girls chest and murdered her:  It happened about two weeks ago. I only found out about it now. I was not a witness. The story is based exclusively on the words of my relative. My relative had a miscarriage because she learned about the fate of her close family, who could not evacuate from Irpin.  Parents were shot by rushists. Most likely, their nine-year-old daughter saw it. The little one was raped by ELEVEN, I cant find a word to say who. Apparently, the Ukrainian language does not have such a word. At least the examination showed that there were 11 different samples of semen on the girls body. According to my relative, the child did not have genitals  non-humans tore it.  They did not stop there. They carved the letter Z on Angels chest and ripped open her tummyAre you saying that Putin is to blame for everything? But it was not Putin who did it! All of Russia must answer for this.the journalist wrote. Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.
When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly.

Under the blanket are 4-5 dead naked women whom Russians tried to burn right there on the side of the road. Photo by mpalinchak russiawarcrimes.jpeg Testimonies of rape survivors Two Russians killed Nataliyas husband and repeatedly raped her On March 22, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced the first case of repeated rape by a Russian serviceman:  A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death.

She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote. On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed.

About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them.

It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko.

Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.
I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote.

Ive been pretty much conditioned to take everything I hear or read from the msm or governments in general with a truckload of salt...... tired of being manipulated.

Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022. Illustrator commented: One day we all hold on, work, volunteer, and another day from this news about the rape of women and girls from the occupied cities there is a feeling of frost on the skin and breaking into pieces Volunteer Vira Khvust recounted the case of her friend who had been raped for more than a week. The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko.

On 4 April, a journalist from local public broadcaster TV UA:Rivne reported about a 9-year-old girl from Irpin raped by 11 Russian soldiers who carved the letter Z on the little girls chest and murdered her:  It happened about two weeks ago. I only found out about it now. I was not a witness. The story is based exclusively on the words of my relative.

Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.
People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said.

Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

The case has been confirmed by the Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova.  Yesterday I received a message from the person I was looking for in all Facebook groups in Kharkiv. My dear Liuba. We have been friends for 10 years. Her story is one of those that destroy from the inside. Writing it, I feel unbearable pain.  She is 29. She lived all her life with her mother. For the last 3 years, her mother had been an invalid. A few days after the war began, as there was already a hole in their house, three Russians broke into their apartment. They took the food, and one of them remained. He broke her phone.  Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal.

On 4 March, Kherson resident Svitlana Zorina told CNN about a 17-year-old girl she personally knows who was raped by Russian occupiers. The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days. It was also reported by Ukrayinska Pravda commentator that Kadyrovs soldiers raped 1516-year-old girls in Borodianka. Aliona Kryvulyak, Director of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotlines Department told DW about three appeals to the organization:  We received the first appeal on March 4 from the Kherson. The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter. The woman admitted that she and her 17-year-old daughter had suffered from gang rape by the Russian occupiers. This is a very traumatic event for the woman herself, and given that she is a mother and in this situation she had neither the physical nor the emotional ability to protect her child.  The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories. On 9 March, executive director at Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Centre Daria Kaleniuk recounted:  My friends, 2 young girls were captured, tortured, raped, and killed. One of them was a brilliant doctor, another one was a scientist and had a Ph.D. Russian soldiers rape and murder Picture by Kateryna Lysenko.

Children. The children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with it and is it worth living at all. How to explain it to yourself? How? Ukrainian ombudswoman Denisova confirmed on 5 April that in Irpin murdered children under the age of 10 with signs of rape and torture had been found. On 4 April, a journalist from local public broadcaster TV UA:Rivne reported about a 9-year-old girl from Irpin raped by 11 Russian soldiers who carved the letter Z on the little girls chest and murdered her:  It happened about two weeks ago. I only found out about it now. I was not a witness. The story is based exclusively on the words of my relative. My relative had a miscarriage because she learned about the fate of her close family, who could not evacuate from Irpin.  Parents were shot by rushists. Most likely, their nine-year-old daughter saw it. The little one was raped by ELEVEN, I cant find a word to say who. Apparently, the Ukrainian language does not have such a word. At least the examination showed that there were 11 different samples of semen on the girls body. According to my relative, the child did not have genitals  non-humans tore it.  They did not stop there. They carved the letter Z on Angels chest and ripped open her tummyAre you saying that Putin is to blame for everything? But it was not Putin who did it! All of Russia must answer for this.the journalist wrote. Rape is legitimized by Russian politics and culture On 7 February 2022 during a press conference after talks with Macron Putin cited the rapist phrase talking about Ukraine:  Like you this or dislikeabide, my beauty, abide! The rhyme was not Putins invention but a modified quote from the song of the Russian group Krasnaya Plesen Red Mold, which is about a rapist:  Beauty sleeps under gravestone, I crept and am fing her Like you or dislike it Sleep, my beauty, sleep! Details on Putins rhetoric towards Ukraine, characteristic of rape culture, and why the international community cant afford to ignore it has been outlined in an article for Ms Magazine written on 3 April 2022. The State Departments 2020 Country Report for Human Rights Practices in Ukraine notes that Russian-led forces reportedly carried out beatings and electric shock in the genital area, rape, threats of rape, forced nudity, and threats of rape against family members in 2020 as a method of torture and mistreatment to punish, humiliate, or extract confessions from detainees. Not only indifference to someones will is apparent in this rhyme Putin modified and cited. The word my is also telling. Like Russia considers Ukraine its country, Russian soldiers sickly and pervertedly believe they have the right to rape Ukrainian women. This in part explains how it is possible that Russians simultaneously support the war against Ukraine and friendship with Ukraine. The Russian soldier shooting Liubas mother in the story above illustrates the kind of love and friendship Russians mean. Literally speaking, rape is a crime against the most intimate, including the most intimate feelings. There are reported cases of girls who had been raped and after that felt so ashamed in front of their own parents and relatives that they committed suicide. British Ambassador to Ukraine fairly writes on 3 April that  Rape is a weapon of war. Though we dont yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine its already clear it was part of the Russian arsenal. Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.

Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it. Russian soldier cut Olhas cheek with a knife as he raped her Holding a gun near Olhas not her real name throat, a 20-year-old Russian soldier raped the woman from Mala Rohan, Kharkiv Oblast. He threatened Olha by shooting into the cellar and cut her cheek with a knife and skin on her neck. Injuries were confirmed by the Human Right Watch which interviewed Olha and published her story on 3 April. On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha not her real name, a 31-year-old woman in Mala Rohan, a village in Kharkiv Oblast that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door. A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office.

The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor.  People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three, Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said:  He told me to give him oral sex. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more motivation. He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear.  While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was name withheld and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with. The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me, she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. I am lucky to be alive, she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal case, which they plan to file with Ukraines prosecutors office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Unwilling to tell Victims are often unwilling to speak out for various reasons, including trauma. Euromaidan Press tried to contact a rape survivor. Her story was briefly recounted on Facebook by her friend, a blogger and volunteer, who in the phone call with us told that Mariya not her real name was asked by three journalists to talk about the crime but refused because of the psychological trauma. She also refuses to report the case to the police. A blogger said that Mariya will be in a psychological rehabilitation program and may decide to speak out in a week or so. As in the case of Nataliyas story above, victims are often urged to speak out by their nearest and dearest. The Ukraine MP who spoke abroad about cases of Russian soldiers who rape in Ukraine says women need time to speak out publicly. For now, hundreds of cases have been reported on social media, and many reports come from politicians, human rights leaders and journalists. russia rape in Ukraine Illustration by Halyna Vehlinska. 1 April 2022.

The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous.

Among the most monstrous cases is the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl by 11 Russian soldiers. Officials and human rights organizations report rape Rape cases have been reported by Ukrainian officials, human rights organizations and MPs. Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said at a briefing at Londons Chatham House: We have numerous cases unfortunately where Russian soldiers have raped women in Ukrainian towns. The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in an answer to Ukrayinska Pravdas public request said on 18 March that they have been receiving complaints from Ukrainians about sexual crimes committed by the Russian military since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Our source at a law enforcement agency told Euromaidan Press that as of 22 March there were nearly one hundred registered cases of rape by Russian soldiers, with many more unregistered cases. The director of the national hotline of the Human rights organization La Strada Ukraine told Deutsche Welle about anonymous reports from victims of rape by Russian soldiers. She also said that rape survivors are rarely ready to speak up or report the crimes to the police because of the trauma, denial of reality, fear, and unwillingness to disclose personal information. Hillary Margolis, a womens rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent that the fact that we are seeing initial reports of cases of rape by troops in Ukraine only indicates there are likely many more that remain unreported. In an interview with Radio Liberty, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine also confirmed that there have been verified cases of rape.

Photo by mpalinchak russiawarcrimes.jpeg Testimonies of rape survivors Two Russians killed Nataliyas husband and repeatedly raped her On March 22, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced the first case of repeated rape by a Russian serviceman:  A Russian serviceman broke into a private house in one of the villages of Brovary district and shot the owner of the house. Later, he and another serviceman of the aggressor country, while intoxicated, repeatedly raped the wife of a murdered civilian, threatening her with violence and weapons, including against her young child, who was with the victim. On 28 March, the Times published an interview with a 33-year-old anonymous woman, Nataliya not her real name, whom the newspaper identified as being at the center of the investigation. The woman stated that on 9 March her husband heard something outside their private house, and walked out. Soon after she heard a single shot:  I cried out, Where is my husband?.. Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy who appeared in his 20s put a gun to my head and said: I shot your husband because hes a Nazi.' Then the two soldiers took turns raping her while her 4-year-old son was crying in the boiler room next door.  He said youd better shut up or Ill get your child and show him his mothers brains spread around the house. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying, How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?the woman told the Times. After the men left, Nataliya went to her son, who was rigid with fear and refusing to move. On 31 March the Ukrainian ombudswoman reported about a 6-year-old boy who turned gray after several days during which Russian occupiers took turns raping his mother in front of him. The case has been reported in Mariupol. The little boys mother died of her wounds. About 20 minutes later the men returned and raped Nataliya again. When the men came for the third time, they were so drunk that they fell asleep and Nataliya and her son could flee:  While I was opening the gate my son was standing next to his fathers body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said will we get shot the same as this man here? When Nataliya was in safety in the west of Ukraine, her sister urged Natalya to report her rape and the murder of her husband to the police:  I could have been silent but when we got to the police my husbands sister made me speak up and there was no going back, Nataliya could not bear to tell her son about his dads death. In the interview, she recalled him:  We wanted to live closer to nature, thats why we didnt live in the city. My husband put his heart and soul into building the house and everything was made of natural wood and stone. We even used to go into the forest to pick litter that other people had left behind...I dont know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it.

The second appeal came from a woman who sheltered a friend and three-year-old son in Vinytsia Oblast. A friend confessed to the woman, who suffered from the gang rape of three Russian occupiers in front of a child. One day, the Russian military came to her in a state of either alcohol or drug intoxication. The child began to cry, they began to make fun of her. Then they began to psychologically insult the woman, aiming a weapon at her and threatening to shoot them both in the head if she did not shut up the child. The victim also confessed to her friend that it was very difficult for her to cope with the experience and asked to take the child away because she simply did not see any sense in living anymore. We suggested that the traumated woman contact us for psychological support, which would be anonymous and confidential. But she still hasnt contacted us.  The third appeal came from a volunteer organization that reported the gang rape of three women in front of children in one of Kyivs cities, which was not officially considered a temporarily occupied territory, but there were many Russian servicemen there. The Russian occupiers first shot the husband of one of the victims and then raped three women in front of their young children. All these appeals were anonymous. But there are many more such cases than we know of. Many victims have been killed and are not able to tell their stories.

Liuba, my dear, who never cries, burst into tears. This nit raped her for more than a week.  And then he began to confess his great love and said he wanted to send her away from the war. She refused, saying that her mother was ill, she would not leave her. And then, this shit, in front of a fragile Liuba, shot the weak old woman. God, Im writing this, and it doesnt fit in my head. I live each story as coldly as possible so as not to go crazy, but not this one. Its like, personal. It hurtsMy dear Liuba is currently on her way to the rehabilitation center, from where she will go abroad. But I cant stop crying.Vira Khvust wrote.

The evacuees also reported Russian soldiers massively raping Ukrainian women, another volunteer told NV on 23 March. Among the victims was an 18-year-old girl who was raped by the occupiers for 8 days.

The woman did not immediately report the rape. She began to say that she and her 17-year-old daughter went to rallies in support of Ukraine, where they faced psychological and physical violence from the Russian occupiers. Then, after some time, the woman told about the rape, but she no longer talked about herself, but about her daughter.
