Harpoon anti-ship missiles have been discussed, but I have not heard of any transfers. It may be a surprise.
It sounds more like it was a long range strike, like a cruise missile, perhaps from a ship offshore.
Authorities in Odesa accused Russian forces of carrying out a strike on residential buildings in the outskirts of the Ukrainian city early on Monday, the first such attack on the Black Sea port city. The city council said there were no casualties although the strike caused a fire.
there is no fall back position, there's no rally point, there is no LZ... we're on our own. FJB
Huh. So the Russian Army that is stalled, in disarray and losing to the Ukes is advancing on Odessa.
Sooner or later, for better or worse, this war is going to be over. So, whos going to re-build and clean up Ukraine? Or whos going to get rich off of it?

Morning near Odesa. Locals shared a video of shooting along the coastline but not reaching buildings. They say it should be some test shots from Russian ships.
I saw some reports that some of the limited landing areas around Odessa had been mined. Harpoon anti-ship missiles have been discussed, but I have not heard of any transfers. It may be a surprise.
since they have no intention of being an occupying force, this is just one of the final dates of the 2022 Ukrainian Punishment Tour...
