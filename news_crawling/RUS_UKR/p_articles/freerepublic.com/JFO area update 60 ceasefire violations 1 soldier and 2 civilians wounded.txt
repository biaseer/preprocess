They are both deep state. UN manages Wars in Korea, Viet Nam, Afghanistan and Africa. Nato only stirs things up in the North Atlantic.

And when the legitimately elected President of the USA attempted to bring some of this up with a newly elected President of the Ukraine: his private phone call was "overheard" by US Military Officer who happened himself to be Ukrainian, and he went to the Deep State and hostile Democrats with his "overheard" information and they ginned up a totally political impeachment designed to take Trump down in an election year.  Main witnesses were the Ukrainian-born US Army officer, and a foreign-born US Ambassador the the Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.  Everything done to Trump and America in this period was spearheaded by people with stong ties to Ukraine. THE POLTIICAL SITUATION After the legitimate elected government of Ukraine was overthrown in 2014, not surprisingly not everyone in the country was anxious to be ruled by the rebel appointed President. Several regions rebelled, broke off and formed their own Republics. In addition the Crimea had an uprising, with Russian support, and at the end of it was annexed by Russia.  Play stupid games coup d'etat against elected leaders win stupid prizes secession of regions of the country that don't want to be ruled by the new self-appointed bosses.  Now, there are plenty of Russian counter-claims to go against the Ukrainian claims that you've posted here. Basically their claims go like this: Russian claims: The Ukrainians are going to attack the break away Republics in the Donbass region.  They have at least as many obviously biased articles to support their claims as the Ukrainians do to support their claims.  Ahhh, the Slavs!

Ukrainian Christians pray outdoors, in the snow, for their country in this phase of war danger.
I'm also reminded that after that US backed coup, somehow the crack-head son of Obama's VP, Biden, got a ridiculous no-show job that paid him over $1 million a year, that we know from the Laptop from Hell that Joe himself was probably getting his "10 for the Big Man".

Now, a lot of weird stuff has gone on with Ukraine. We had a coup d'etat in 2014, that was a classic Soros style "color revoution". The Democratically elected government that was pro-Russian was deposed and replaced with a new, unelected Government that was pro EU and USA.  That was the event that set things on the present course.

That was the event that set things on the present course.  I'm also reminded that after that US backed coup, somehow the crack-head son of Obama's VP, Biden, got a ridiculous no-show job that paid him over $1 million a year, that we know from the Laptop from Hell that Joe himself was probably getting his "10 for the Big Man".  And when the legitimately elected President of the USA attempted to bring some of this up with a newly elected President of the Ukraine: his private phone call was "overheard" by US Military Officer who happened himself to be Ukrainian, and he went to the Deep State and hostile Democrats with his "overheard" information and they ginned up a totally political impeachment designed to take Trump down in an election year.  Main witnesses were the Ukrainian-born US Army officer, and a foreign-born US Ambassador the the Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.  Everything done to Trump and America in this period was spearheaded by people with stong ties to Ukraine. THE POLTIICAL SITUATION After the legitimate elected government of Ukraine was overthrown in 2014, not surprisingly not everyone in the country was anxious to be ruled by the rebel appointed President. Several regions rebelled, broke off and formed their own Republics. In addition the Crimea had an uprising, with Russian support, and at the end of it was annexed by Russia.  Play stupid games coup d'etat against elected leaders win stupid prizes secession of regions of the country that don't want to be ruled by the new self-appointed bosses.  Now, there are plenty of Russian counter-claims to go against the Ukrainian claims that you've posted here. Basically their claims go like this: Russian claims: The Ukrainians are going to attack the break away Republics in the Donbass region.  They have at least as many obviously biased articles to support their claims as the Ukrainians do to support their claims.  Ahhh, the Slavs!  For instance: LIVE UPDATES: Kiev's Forces Fire Over 400 Shells Towards DPR, Situation Remains Acute, Donetsk Says In philosophical terms: I don't see the breakup of corrupt, failing multi-cultural super-states Ukraine into federaltions of smaller independent, homogeneous Republics as something so horrible that the USA should get involved, particularly when the areas in question border on Russia.  I hope we stay out of it.

In philosophical terms: I don't see the breakup of corrupt, failing multi-cultural super-states Ukraine into federaltions of smaller independent, homogeneous Republics as something so horrible that the USA should get involved, particularly when the areas in question border on Russia.  I hope we stay out of it.
You are aware that the UN and NATO are not the same thing? They are both deep state. UN manages Wars in Korea, Viet Nam, Afghanistan and Africa. Nato only stirs things up in the North Atlantic.
Lets pray for all the families in Ukraine, in the face of these particularly critical times may God grant wisdom, discernment, strength, courage, protection to His children, to the authorities and to the whole population!

THE POLTIICAL SITUATION After the legitimate elected government of Ukraine was overthrown in 2014, not surprisingly not everyone in the country was anxious to be ruled by the rebel appointed President. Several regions rebelled, broke off and formed their own Republics. In addition the Crimea had an uprising, with Russian support, and at the end of it was annexed by Russia.  Play stupid games coup d'etat against elected leaders win stupid prizes secession of regions of the country that don't want to be ruled by the new self-appointed bosses.  Now, there are plenty of Russian counter-claims to go against the Ukrainian claims that you've posted here. Basically their claims go like this: Russian claims: The Ukrainians are going to attack the break away Republics in the Donbass region.  They have at least as many obviously biased articles to support their claims as the Ukrainians do to support their claims.  Ahhh, the Slavs!  For instance: LIVE UPDATES: Kiev's Forces Fire Over 400 Shells Towards DPR, Situation Remains Acute, Donetsk Says In philosophical terms: I don't see the breakup of corrupt, failing multi-cultural super-states Ukraine into federaltions of smaller independent, homogeneous Republics as something so horrible that the USA should get involved, particularly when the areas in question border on Russia.  I hope we stay out of it.

However, going to be hard for Russia to deny their attacks as it was published by RADIO LIBERTY, correspondents were at the scene.
After the legitimate elected government of Ukraine was overthrown in 2014, not surprisingly not everyone in the country was anxious to be ruled by the rebel appointed President. Several regions rebelled, broke off and formed their own Republics. In addition the Crimea had an uprising, with Russian support, and at the end of it was annexed by Russia.  Play stupid games coup d'etat against elected leaders win stupid prizes secession of regions of the country that don't want to be ruled by the new self-appointed bosses.  Now, there are plenty of Russian counter-claims to go against the Ukrainian claims that you've posted here. Basically their claims go like this: Russian claims: The Ukrainians are going to attack the break away Republics in the Donbass region.  They have at least as many obviously biased articles to support their claims as the Ukrainians do to support their claims.  Ahhh, the Slavs!  For instance: LIVE UPDATES: Kiev's Forces Fire Over 400 Shells Towards DPR, Situation Remains Acute, Donetsk Says In philosophical terms: I don't see the breakup of corrupt, failing multi-cultural super-states Ukraine into federaltions of smaller independent, homogeneous Republics as something so horrible that the USA should get involved, particularly when the areas in question border on Russia.

Censornet is a leading Ukrainian news source. So, of course they are promoting their version of events. Essentially the Ukrainians are promoting this simple story:  Ukrainians: "Russia is getting ready to invade us".  Now, a lot of weird stuff has gone on with Ukraine. We had a coup d'etat in 2014, that was a classic Soros style "color revoution". The Democratically elected government that was pro-Russian was deposed and replaced with a new, unelected Government that was pro EU and USA.  That was the event that set things on the present course.  I'm also reminded that after that US backed coup, somehow the crack-head son of Obama's VP, Biden, got a ridiculous no-show job that paid him over $1 million a year, that we know from the Laptop from Hell that Joe himself was probably getting his "10 for the Big Man".  And when the legitimately elected President of the USA attempted to bring some of this up with a newly elected President of the Ukraine: his private phone call was "overheard" by US Military Officer who happened himself to be Ukrainian, and he went to the Deep State and hostile Democrats with his "overheard" information and they ginned up a totally political impeachment designed to take Trump down in an election year.  Main witnesses were the Ukrainian-born US Army officer, and a foreign-born US Ambassador the the Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.  Everything done to Trump and America in this period was spearheaded by people with stong ties to Ukraine. THE POLTIICAL SITUATION After the legitimate elected government of Ukraine was overthrown in 2014, not surprisingly not everyone in the country was anxious to be ruled by the rebel appointed President. Several regions rebelled, broke off and formed their own Republics. In addition the Crimea had an uprising, with Russian support, and at the end of it was annexed by Russia.  Play stupid games coup d'etat against elected leaders win stupid prizes secession of regions of the country that don't want to be ruled by the new self-appointed bosses.  Now, there are plenty of Russian counter-claims to go against the Ukrainian claims that you've posted here. Basically their claims go like this: Russian claims: The Ukrainians are going to attack the break away Republics in the Donbass region.  They have at least as many obviously biased articles to support their claims as the Ukrainians do to support their claims.  Ahhh, the Slavs!  For instance: LIVE UPDATES: Kiev's Forces Fire Over 400 Shells Towards DPR, Situation Remains Acute, Donetsk Says In philosophical terms: I don't see the breakup of corrupt, failing multi-cultural super-states Ukraine into federaltions of smaller independent, homogeneous Republics as something so horrible that the USA should get involved, particularly when the areas in question border on Russia.
