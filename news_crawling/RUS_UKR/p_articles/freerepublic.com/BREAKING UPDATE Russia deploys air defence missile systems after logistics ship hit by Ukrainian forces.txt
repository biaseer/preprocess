At this point the bigger issue facing the orcs is that Ukrainian artillery has been considerably upgraded this month and their range has been extended out to 25 miles. Which puts the island within the range of shore batteries.

Ill bet the Ukies would be happy to do some of the current, I believe field testing on our USAs M777ER Howitzer. 43 miles range using the XM1113 rocket-assisted projectile. I seem to recall the new extended range barrel goes on the existing carriage.
I have said that without a navy Ukraine cant hold the island, and without an effective air defense Russia cant hold it either. Well see if Russia can fix that problem. I thought it was a mistake for Ukraine to have not leased this island to a NATO country to keep it out of Russia's control. They could have done a 1 year lease and renewed as needed. Maybe that will have proved unnecessary. This island is serving as a lure to attract the hapless Russian navy and attrit it. If so, it's a good thing. The Russians having been serving up targets for the Ukies to test their weapons systems against.

Ukrainian Defence Ministrys Main Intelligence Directorate stated: The Head of the Ukrainian Defence Ministrys State Defence Troops Main Directorate said on a nationwide telethon that the Zminiiy island is strategically important both for Ukraine and the Russian invaders because it allows them to control the surface and in some way the air situation on the east of Ukraine. Also the Zminiiy Island is strategically important in terms of the possibility of Russias landing of a tactical maritime landing force. In the words of Major General Cyril Budanov: Theoretically it is the only region through which the Russian invaders could try to land troops on the territory of the occupied Transnistrian region of Moldova. Whoever controls the island can block the passage of civilian ships in all directions to the south of Ukraine. Zminiiy Island is the territory of Ukraine and we will buy it and fight for it as much as we need. This is a strategically important point in order to open trading maritime routes, to bring us the ammunition and to exclude any possible military activities of Russia on the territory of the TMR, from which they can attack the western part of Ukraine, said the Head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.
