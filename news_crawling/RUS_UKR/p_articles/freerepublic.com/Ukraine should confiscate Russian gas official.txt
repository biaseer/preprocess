Russia is the largest supplier of gas to the EU, part of which is pumped via pipelines passing through Ukraine. In December 2019, Moscow and Kiev agreed to extend the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine for the period of 2020-2024, with the possibility of extending the agreement for another ten years. The contract envisages transiting 65 bcm of gas in 2020 and 40 bcm annually from 2021 to 2024. Back in 2006, parts of Europe were left without heat during one of the coldest winters on record after Ukraine started siphoning off Russian gas destined for the European market.
