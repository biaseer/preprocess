The Russian Ministry of Defense on March 6 issued a statement on Telegram accusing Ukraine of having destroyed disease-causing pathogens being studied at a lab in Ukraine that the ministry said is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.Russias allegations regarding the biological laboratories appeared to be repeated by the Chinese regime on March 7.The World Health Organization confirmed in March that it advised the Ministry of Health in Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills.But analysts believe that the narrative being pushed by the Kremlin is part of its plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.Rosenbaum told officials on Friday that, the department remains very concerned about the ability to get accurate and transparent information out to the U.S. public, as well as certainly our allies and the rest of the world.So one of the things that the department has been doingand this is particularly related to the public health laboratories in Ukraine that is being tragically used by the Russians as a potential for a false flag operationfrom the White House on down to the Defense Department, as well as Department of State, as well as all of the vehicles that we have to be able to communicate accurate information out about this and the work that has been underway, Rosenbaum said.Robert Pope, the director of the DTRAs Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, told the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in February that the labs might contain Soviet-era bioweapons and warned that the conflict in Ukraine could accidentally lead to the dangerous disease-causing pathogens being released.I think the Russians know enough about the kinds of pathogens that are stored in biological research laboratories that I dont think they would deliberately target a laboratory, Pope said. But what I do have concerns about is that they would  be accidentally damaged during this Russian invasion.Rosenbaums comments come shortly after White House press secretary Jen Psaki cautioned officials to be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.The White Houses concerns have also been repeated by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the UKs Ministry of Defense, which said last month that it had seen no evidence to support the accusations made by Russia.
...brought to you by the same people who still wont release all of the documents about Fauxi illegally funding banned gain-of-function experiments in Wuhan China using taxpayers money.
Whether this is bad, all hinges on what the meaning of the word is... is.
does not pass the smell test. Why have the labs in a country that cant be monitored in an effective way? The difference between weaponization and research is not big at all and if you were to weaponize it you would want the lab near the deployment area so securing methods against accidental release are in place.
The Pentagon funds labs in Ukraine through its Defense Threat Reduction Agency DTRA, a support agency within the Department of Defense for countering weapons of mass destruction, and both U.S and Ukraine officials say the labs seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens.According to a Pentagon fact sheet released in March pdf, since 2005, the United States has invested approximately $200 million in Ukraine  supporting 46 Ukrainian laboratories, health facilities, and diagnostic sites.The Biological Threat Reduction Program has improved Ukraines biological safety, security, and surveillance for both human and animal health, the Pentagon fact sheet states.However, Russia has in recent months accused the U.S.-funded laboratories in Ukraine of developing biological warfare weapons. Such allegations were being aired on Russian state-run media even prior to the Moscow-led invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.The Russian Ministry of Defense on March 6 issued a statement on Telegram accusing Ukraine of having destroyed disease-causing pathogens being studied at a lab in Ukraine that the ministry said is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.Russias allegations regarding the biological laboratories appeared to be repeated by the Chinese regime on March 7.The World Health Organization confirmed in March that it advised the Ministry of Health in Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills.But analysts believe that the narrative being pushed by the Kremlin is part of its plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.Rosenbaum told officials on Friday that, the department remains very concerned about the ability to get accurate and transparent information out to the U.S. public, as well as certainly our allies and the rest of the world.So one of the things that the department has been doingand this is particularly related to the public health laboratories in Ukraine that is being tragically used by the Russians as a potential for a false flag operationfrom the White House on down to the Defense Department, as well as Department of State, as well as all of the vehicles that we have to be able to communicate accurate information out about this and the work that has been underway, Rosenbaum said.Robert Pope, the director of the DTRAs Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, told the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in February that the labs might contain Soviet-era bioweapons and warned that the conflict in Ukraine could accidentally lead to the dangerous disease-causing pathogens being released.I think the Russians know enough about the kinds of pathogens that are stored in biological research laboratories that I dont think they would deliberately target a laboratory, Pope said. But what I do have concerns about is that they would  be accidentally damaged during this Russian invasion.Rosenbaums comments come shortly after White House press secretary Jen Psaki cautioned officials to be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.The White Houses concerns have also been repeated by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the UKs Ministry of Defense, which said last month that it had seen no evidence to support the accusations made by Russia.

Yeah right, then why were we in such a hurry to dispose of all biological samples and records before the Russians got there? US propaganda is getting more ridiculous all the time.
We are swimming in a cesspool of lies so fetid its impossible to know whats true.

A few weeks ago the claim was there were no bio labs funded by the US in Ukraine.
