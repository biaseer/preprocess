A video which apparently shows a Ukrainian man attempting to block a Russian military convoy has gone viral online, with comparisons being drawn to the tank man of Tiananmen Square.
I personally respect Putin for putting the goals of Russia above those of the world - all political heads of state should - but hes still a KGB thug with delusions of Soviet grandeur. Having traded some rounds with Soviets back in the 80s, Im no fan of them.
That, my friends, is a man with very big balls. I am humbled by his naked expression of courage and devotion to country.
I know of far too many conservatives that think Putin is doing the right thing. After speaking to them at length, it becomes apparent that they have zero knowledge about Europe or its recent history.
I dare say none of the useless wokesters in America would have the fortitude to do such a thing.
But fighting in a war you are likely to lose is another level of courage.
Ive seen that and wondered. Some old accounts too. Makes me think stagnant accounts with simple passwords have been hacked by disinformation workers.
or as a small handful of people around here would say, a cabal agent trying to block the benevolent forces of Putin.
