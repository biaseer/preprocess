The Russians say a missile cruiser called the Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, experienced a fire on board Wednesday that caused munitions to explode. Russia's Tass news agency quoted Kremlin officials as saying the vessel's crew of roughly 500 sailors has now been evacuated and an investigation of the blaze is underway.
The Moskva gained notoriety at the start of the war when its crew called on Ukrainian border troops defending the strategic Snake Island to surrender only to be refused with profanity. The Ukrainian troops in question were initially believed to have been killed but were actually taken captive and released in a prisoner swap in early March.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials claimed that they attacked the Moskva, damaging the vessel with Neptune cruise missiles which are designed for use against ships. Neither account could be independently confirmed and there's no information on how many Russian sailors were killed or injured.
