The spokesman said the department is in close contact with the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing and with colleagues in other jurisdictions.
Taoiseach Michel Martin said at the weekend that the Republic has so far accepted 5,500 Ukrainian refugees, and may take in more than 100,000.
"We will participate fully in this humanitarian effort. Partnership across sectors and wider society will be key to ensuring we can support as many Ukrainian people seeking sanctuary here as possible."
"While not all the details have yet been announced by Westminster, we are working at pace, making preparations so we stand ready to provide sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees," the spokesman said.
Paul Givan resigned earlier this year as part of the DUP's action against the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The Executive Office has strongly encouraged expressions of interest, and these can be made through an online portal due to open today.
Concern had been expressed over Northern Ireland's contribution to the Ukraine response in the absence of a First and deputy First Minister in office to lead the effort.
Patrick Corrigan, of Amnesty International, said: "I am concerned that the absence of a First Minister and deputy First Minister, who have lead responsibility for refugee matters, has led to Northern Ireland being left behind when it comes to playing our part in offering a welcome to refugees from Ukraine."
