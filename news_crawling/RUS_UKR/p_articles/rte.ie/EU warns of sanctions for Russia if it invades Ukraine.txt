"But Europe and our colleagues globally are prepared to respond strongly to Russia should they escalate the situation," she said.
"And that is why we have said to Russia there will be consequences and they will feel them very strongly," she stated.
"We stand with Ukraine and we have been very clear about that, while also working on the diplomatic front."
The EU Commissioner for financial services, financial stability and Capital Markets Union has warned there will be severe consequences for Russia if there is an escalation in the situation in Ukraine.
But Ms McGuinness added that the EU is preparing and has warned there will be sanctions if Russia invades.
She added that even today they continue to hear stories of concern, but still hope a diplomatic solution will be found.
"And that is why the response is already in place, should there be an escalation."
"But our clear focus with our allies is to say that we cannot allow an escalation, should that take place, and things are quite alarming today, to go without a response."
But Mairead McGuinness said the EU is still hopeful that a diplomatic solution will be found.
Speaking at the Financial Times and IDA Ireland European Financial Forum 2022 Ms McGuinness said Europe is united with its colleagues in the US and UK in supporting the voice of Ukraine.
She said they continue to work on diplomacy and are hoping the "worst won't come to the worst."
