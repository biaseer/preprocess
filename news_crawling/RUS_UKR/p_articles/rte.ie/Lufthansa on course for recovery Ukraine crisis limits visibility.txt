"Now we are leaving the crisis behind us mentally and - in view of the strong booking figures this year - also in business terms," he added.
"We are very sure that air traffic will experience a strong upswing this year," said chief executive Carsten Spohr.
The company reported a 2021 operating loss of 2.3 billion, in line with analyst forecasts.
But major uncertainties regarding developments in Ukraine and the economic and political fallout, as well as uncertainties regarding the course of the pandemic, did not allow the company to provide a detailed financial outlook, Lufthansa said.
Airlines are bracing for potentially lengthy blockages of key east-west flight corridors and preparing for further disruptions to its passenger and freight businesses.
The airline said it expected significant improvement in operating results for the rest of the year after a challenging first quarter of 2022.
Germany's Lufthansa, which narrowed its losses in 2021 but remained in the red, said today that it could not provide a detailed outlook for 2022 due to the war in Ukraine and the pandemic.
Moscow has closed its airspace to European and US aircraft after European states and the US banned Russian flights.
Lufthansa Group, which includes Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and Swiss, plans to offer more than 70 of its pre-crisis capacity this year, rising to 85 for the summer.
