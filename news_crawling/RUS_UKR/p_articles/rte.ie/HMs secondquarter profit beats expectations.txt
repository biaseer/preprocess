Its biggest rival Inditex, the owner of Zara, had also reported an 80 jump in first-quarter profit on the back of soaring sales.
The company reported a pretax profit of 4.78 billion Swedish crowns $470.76m in the second quarter, up from 3.59 billion crowns a year earlier.
Despite increased costs, an increase in full-price sales and decrease in markdowns helped HM to increase operating margins to 9.2 from 8.3.
Sales were up 12 year-on-year when measured in local currencies, at 54.5 billion crowns in its fiscal second quarter, the Swedish company said in a statement.
"Sales in physical stores increased substantially while online continues to do well," chief executive Helena Helmersson said in a statement.
"Disruption and delays still exist in the supply chain, but are gradually being eased," Helmersson said.
Sweden's HM, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, has reported a 33 growth in quarterly profit which beat expectations, as shoppers flocked to its stores in the aftermath of the pandemic.
The company has temporarily closed its stores in Russia in March after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February. The country was HM's sixth-biggest market with 4 of sales in the fourth quarter of 2021.
It also closed stores in China, where consumer demand has slumped due to Covid-19 lockdowns.
High raw material and transport costs have been a hurdle for fashion retailers and companies have been passing them to consumers by hiking prices.
HM said sales in June are expected to fall by 6 in local currencies compared with a year earlier, mostly because of the halting of its business in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
