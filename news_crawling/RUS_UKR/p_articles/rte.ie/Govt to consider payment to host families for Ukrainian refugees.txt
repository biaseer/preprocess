Speaking on Newstalk, Roderic O'Gorman said other countries, such as Poland, are using large stadiums as a temporary housing measure to shelter Ukrainian refugees.
"I think it is likely that some of this larger scale accommodation will be into the medium term," he said.
The Taoiseach Michel Martin has said the Government will examine making payments to individuals who host Ukrainian refugees in their homes.
He said this was part of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategy to create pressures on democracies by creating so much migration.
While the numbers of people arriving are slightly lower than in previous weeks, he said a greater number of people do not have any connections with the country and require accommodation from the State.
Mr O'Gorman said 21,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in the State and around 13,000 are being accommodated in state-provided accommodation.
He said the Government would continue to examine supports that local authorities could provide pledges made by Irish families to provide accommodation and older institutional buildings that could be converted to provide shelter.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Children said the State has "probably reached the limits in terms of hotel or bb accommodation" that can be provided to Ukrainian refugees and other means of accommodation must now be explored.
Mr Martin said accommodation for refugees is becoming extremely challenging because thousands have arrived in a few weeks in what he said was an unprecedented situation.
He said that this is a wartime situation and the primary objective is to provide security to those in need.
