NATO meanwhile called Russias attack on Ukraine entirely unjustified and unprovoked in a statement on Thursday.
After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putinjustified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine  a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russias demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.
In a briefing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's attack on Ukraine was "dictated only by our national interests and concern for the future."
"These are the only goals," he said."No one talks about occupation, this word does not apply here.Russias aim isneutralization of Ukraines military potential."
Russia, which for weeks has denied plans to invade Ukraine, said Thursday it aims to neutralize Ukraine's "military potential" as it launched attacks on the country.
