MOSCOW - Concerns are growing that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will likely disrupt the supply of wheat to Africa.
This will hit poor countries and their poorest citizens the hardest with the effects flowing through to meat and egg prices.
There's been heightened food insecurity in some parts of the continent, including Somalia, which is experiencing its worst drought in decades.
The World Food Programme WFP on Tuesday said it was concerned that trade disruptions and economic sanctions on Russia could lead to food shortage and higher prices, especially in the short term.
