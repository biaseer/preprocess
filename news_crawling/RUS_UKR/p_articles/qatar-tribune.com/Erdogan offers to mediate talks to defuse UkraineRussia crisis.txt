dpaIstanbulKievTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered to host high-level talks between Ukraine and Russia to try to ratchet down tensions between the neighbours.We will be happy to host a summit on a leaders level or technical-level talks, Erdogan told a press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Kiev.Ankara backs its strategic partner Ukraines territorial integrity, including in Russian-held Crimea, he added.Zelensky thanked Erdogan for his efforts and said Erdogans visit showed Turkey is a friend of Ukraine. The Turkish president is the latest in a series of leaders to visit Kiev. The prime ministers of Britain, the Netherlands and Poland have all been there amid a flurry of diplomatic activity to avert the possibility of war in Eastern Europe.Erdogan urged parties to exercise restraint and called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, which involves a massive build-up of Russian troops along Ukraines borders.Moscow denies it has plans to invade. The West is sceptical, however, saying Russia has for years been illegally occupying Crimea and fuelling conflict in eastern Ukraine between the government and Russian-backed separatists.Even before his visit on Thursday, Erdogan had already offered to host peace talks between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia.While Kiev accepted, the reaction from Moscow was muted. Erdogan separately invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Ankara for one-to-one talks, but Moscow hasnt confirmed yet.NATO member Turkey tries to maintain good relations with both Ukraine and Russia.Last year, Turkeys refusal to recognize the Crimean results of the Russian parliamentary election and its sales of combat drones to Ukraine stoked tensions between Ankara and Moscow.Russia and Turkey are also working together to find a political settlement in the Syrian conflict although they back opposing sides.Russia remains the top supplier of natural gas for Turkey and sent the highest number of tourists to Turkey in 2022.Erdogan and Zelensky signed a free trade agreement on Thursday, which the latter referred to as a historical achievement, among other deals, including in trade, defence and technology.Turkish private defence company Baykar will produce drones in Ukraine, Zelensky added.Turkish technology transfer or sales of combat drones to Ukraine is not a game-changer in the conflict with Russia, argues Ankara-based political analyst Hseyin Oylupinar, of the Foreign Policy Institute.Turkey has always been a very careful regional partner towards these two countries, Oylupinar told dpa, adding there is little Ankara can probably achieve from bringing the two to the table.Turkey does not want to get on the wrong side of Russia, he adds, noting: If it does so, there is going to be a very negative effect on every other issue that Turkey contests with Russia ... You can expect more complications in Syria, North Africa and in number of bilateral issues.
