Russias military said Tuesday it would fundamentally cut back operations near Ukraines capital and a northern city, as talks brought a possible deal to end a grinding and brutal war into view.Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said the move was meant to increase trust in the talks after several rounds of failed negotiations to halt the conflict that has devolved into a bloody campaign of attrition.Fomin said Moscow had decided to fundamentally ... cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv to increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.That appeared to be a goodwill gesture, but also comes as Russias troops have become bogged down and struggled to make major advances on the ground recently in the face of stiff Ukrainian resistance, thwarting Russian President Vladimir Putins aim of a quick military victory.Ukraines military said it had noted withdrawals around Kyiv and Chernihiv, though the Pentagon said it could not corroborate Russias claim.Earlier talks, held in person in Belarus or by video, failed to make progress on ending a more than month-long war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes  including almost 4 million from their country.But Fomin suggested there had been progress Tuesday, saying negotiations on preparing an agreement on Ukraines neutrality and non-nuclear status, as well as on giving Ukraine security guarantees, are turning to practical matters.Ukraines team, meanwhile, set out a detailed framework for a future peace deal under which the country would remain neutral but its security would be guaranteed by a group of third countries, including the U.S., Britain, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to NATOs an attack on one is an attack on all principle.Ukraine would also be willing to hold talks over a 15-year period on the future of the Crimean Peninsula, which was seized by Russia in 2014, with both countries agreeing not to use their armed forces to resolve the issue in the meantime.Russias views on the proposals were not immediately clear.Ahead of the talks, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality. Moscow has demanded that the country drop any hope of joining the NATO alliance, which it sees as a threat. Zelenskyy also said he was open to compromise over the contested eastern region of Donbas  comments that might lend momentum to negotiations.But even as the negotiators assembled in Istanbul, Russian forces hit an oil depot in western Ukraine and demolished a government building in the south, with several deaths.A missile struck the oil depot late Monday, the second attack on oil facilities in a region that has been spared the worst of the fighting. On Tuesday morning, an explosion blasted a hole in a nine-story administration building in Mykolaiv, a southern port city that Russia has unsuccessfully tried to capture.Seven people died in the missile attack and 22 were wounded, Zelenskyy said in an address to Danish lawmakers.Its terrible. They waited for people to go to work before striking the building, said regional governor Vitaliy Kim. I overslept. Im lucky.
