Russia has said its troops could target supplies of Western weapons in Ukraine as it intensified attacks near Kyiv. We warned the United States that the orchestrated pumping of weapons from a number of countries is not just a dangerous move, it is a move that turns these convoys into legitimate targets, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state television on Saturday. US President Joe Biden has signed off on another tranche of military funding for Ukraine, amounting to $200 million. This follows the $350 million in aid for the Ukrainian armed forces approved by Biden just two weeks ago. Ukraine accused Russian forces on Saturday of killing seven civilians in an attack on women and children trying to flee fighting near Kyiv.
