Ukraine has accused Russian forces of carrying out a massacre in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow.Russias defence ministry denied the Ukrainian allegations, saying footage and photographs showing bodies in Bucha were yet another provocation by the Ukrainian government. The images from Bucha came after Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had reclaimed control of the whole Kyiv region and liberated towns from Russian troops.They prompted outrage in Ukraine and abroad, adding to pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by increasing the likelihood of further Western sanctions. Western nations have already sought to isolate Russia economically and punish it for the invasion, which began on Feb. 24.Bucha massacre was deliberate, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.
