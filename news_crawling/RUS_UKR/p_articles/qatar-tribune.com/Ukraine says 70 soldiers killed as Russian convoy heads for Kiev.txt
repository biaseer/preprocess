dpaKievRussian forces pushed ahead with their assaults on key Ukrainian territories on Tuesday, including the capital Kiev and the countrys east, where dozens of Ukrainian soldiers were killed in an airstrike.Seventy Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the Russian missile attack in the region of Sumy, the Ukrainian parliament confirmed.It said on Twitter that an army unit was fired upon in the town of Okhtyrka, located between Kiev and Kharkiv, where Ukrainian forces have also faced intense attacks by the Russians.The deaths in Okhtyrka were announced by Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, head of Sumys regional administration, who shared pictures on his Telegram channel of a burnt-out four-storey building and rescue workers in action.Fighting was also continuing in the countrys south, with Russian separatists saying they would set up two humanitarian corridors for residents to leave the embattled port city of Mariupol.People will have until Wednesday to leave, a spokesman for the insurgents in the Donetsk region, Eduard Basurin, said on Tuesday, according to the Interfax news agency.As Russias invasion of Ukraine progressed through its sixth day, concerns are growing about the number of civilian casualties in the conflict.The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry published a video on Twitter on Tuesday showing a missile attack that struck Freedom Square in central Kharkiv. Cars can be seen driving outside the administrative building before it is hit by a powerful explosion.Russia is waging war in violation of international humanitarian law, the ministry wrote. Kills civilians, destroys civilian infrastructure. Russias main target is large cities that now fired at by its missiles. Russia has rejected the allegations, which can not be independently verified.According to Ukrainian sources, 11 people were killed and dozens injured in attacks on Kharkiv over the course of Monday. Eighty-seven residential buildings were destroyed.The United Nations estimates that more than 100 civilians have died during Russias invasion of Ukraine. Ukraines government puts the civilian toll at more than 150.Meanwhile, satellite imagery showed a convoy of Russian military vehicles estimated to be 64 kilometres long heading towards Kiev, Ukrainian news agency UNIANreported.The violence has been met with an onslaught of unprecedented sanctions from Western nations targeting Russian politicians, businesspeople and banks.But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday the measures would not deter Moscow from its course in the war against Ukraine.They probably think that they can force us to change our position with sanctions, Peskov said on Tuesday, according to Interfax.It is obvious that there is no question of that, no one will change their position, said Peskov, who has also personally been hit with sanctions.The European Union put sanctions in place on Monday targeting oligarchs and other people close to Putin. Among other things, the move has led to the freezing of Russian assets in the EU.Putin clearly underestimated Europe before the attack on Ukraine, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said.Perhaps Putin had thought us impotent, divided or intoxicated by our wealth. He was wrong. We were and are ready to respond and fight back, Draghi said in Rome during a speech in the Senate.But Peskov shrugged off the measures, saying, We have no assets in the West, we have no accounts in the West, punish us. The Kremlin spokesman also said it was too early to make any assessments on peace talks held between Russia and Ukraine at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border on Monday.
