Ramgarh: The BJP MP from Hazaribag and former Union minister of state for finance, Jayant Sinha, said the Indian economy has the potential to tide over the fallouts of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia.He was speaking on the sidelines of a programme of the Akhil Bharatiya Kaisthya Maha Sabha on Sunday.The BJP MP said, The partial impact of the Russia-Ukraine war in our country is likely to continue for the next six months, but our economy is intact and strong enough to bear the shocks. All necessary steps are being taken by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government and people need not be worried about any major crisis.He further said that a few marginal impacts of the war, such as shortage of wheat, sunflower oil and a hike in crude oil prices, are felt but claimed that these would normalise soon. With strong foundations, our economy is intact and hence despite the global crisis due to the war, we could launch a subsidised foodgrain scheme which will bring a huge relief to the poor, said Sinha, who recently bagged the best MP award.
