LONDONNEW DELHI: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a phone call to discuss the Ukraine crisis with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday evening that the UK and India should intensify efforts to promote peace and de-escalation in the region, while Modi reiterated Indias consistent appeal for cessation of hostilities and a return to the path of dialogue and diplomacy.According to the UK readout of the call to shore up support from India, PM Modi agreed with Johnson that Ukraines integrity and territorial sovereignty must be respected.But Modi, unlike Johnson, did not condemn Putins actions in Ukraine. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: The leaders discussed the grave situation in Ukraine, and the UK Prime Minister said he believed the actions of Putins regime were deeply disturbing and disastrous for the world Russia needed to adhere to the UN Charter, the leaders saidA PMO statement in New Delhi said Modi emphasised India's belief in respect for international law and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states as the basis of the contemporary world order.Modi also updated the UK PM on Indias support for the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.The two leaders also discussed issues of bilateral interests and agreed on the potential of further deepening cooperation in various areas including trade, technology, investments, defence  security, and people-to-people relations, the PMO said, adding, Prime Minister Modi expressed his satisfaction at the positive momentum in the ongoing negotiations on the bilateral Free Trade Agreement. Modi also appreciated the progress in implementing the India-UK Roadmap 2030 adopted during the virtual summit between both leaders last year.The Prime Minister conveyed his desire to welcome PM Johnson in India at an early date, as per mutual convenience, the PMO said.India has come under fire in both the House of Commons and House of Lords in recent weeks for refusing to condemn outright the Russian invasion of Ukraine by abstaining on the UN Security Council draft resolution and the UNGA resolution, both of which called for the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces.During topical questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday Labour MP Chris Bryant asked: Should we not be putting more pressure on companies  such as Infosys in India  that have big investments in Russia?Last week in the House of Lords during a debate on Ukraine, Lord Purvis of Tweed said: The positions of China and India are of course of concern to UK interests. The UK is in discussions with India about a free trade agreement. It is reported that India is in discussions with Russia for a rupeerouble trading arrangement that would circumvent the sanctions restrictions. Does the minister believe that it is disagreeable that the UK will be offering preferential market access to the very financiers who are circumventing our restrictions?Lord Cormack said at the same debate: Is it not particularly sad for us that India, the greatest democracy in size and a crucially important member of the Commonwealth, is taking the abstaining line in the UN? Should we not be endeavouring with every diplomatic effort to ensure that India comes on side, as a democracy should?The minister for India, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, responded: India is a key strategic partner. We are building strong alliances and having clear discussions with India about its role both in conflict resolution and the long-term situation pertaining to Ukraine. India also recognises its important role. Of course, it has a strong historic relationship with Russia, but it also recognises that what has happened is an unprovoked attack on a sovereign state.Earlier UK foreign secretary Liz Truss had said: Every sovereign nation that believes in fair play and the rule of law around the world should be doing all it can to stop Putin being successful in Ukraine. That includes India, China and every other country around the world.
