Australian shares rose on Monday as heavyweight mining stocks hit a record high and the gold sub-index rallied, although gains were capped by escalations in the Ukraine crisis. The SPASX 200 index was up about 0.4 at 7,525 by 0105 GMT. The benchmark fell 0.1 on Friday. Ukraine on Sunday accused Russia of carrying out a "massacre" in the town of Bucha, and Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies with calls for new sanctions on Russia, which kept a lid on investor mood. Mining stocks climbed 1.4. Iron ore futures in China closed at a near 8-month high on Friday as hopes for economic stimulus rose following a month of COVID-19 induced lockdowns. Global miner BHP Group rose 0.8 and peers Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group added 1.2 and 3.1, respectively. Mineral sands explorer Iluka Resources jumped as much as 8.5 after its board approved a rare earths refinery project, and securing government funding for it. Gold stocks climbed 2.4 and hit a near three-week high. Newcrest Mining, Australia's largest listed gold miner, rose 1.4, while Northern Star also climbed 2.9. Heavyweight banks were mixed, with the financial index rising 0.1. However, two out of so-called "Big Four" banks traded lower. The mixed mood comes ahead of an interest-rate decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday. A Reuters poll expects the RBA to hold its official cash rate at 0.1. National Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group lost 0.4 and 0.04, respectively, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp rose 0.1 and 0.2. Investment manager Pendal Group soared 24.1 on receiving a around A$2.4 billion $1.80 billion buyout offer from asset manager Perpetual Ltd. Markets in New Zealand rose about 0.2 to 12,108.11, as at 0105 GMT. Reporting by Harshita Swaminathan editing by Uttaresh.V
