The United Nations suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council on Thursday for "systemic violations" by Russians troops in Ukraine. While India abstained from the vote saying any such decision must follow the "due process" of investigation first, China strongly opposed the US-backed resolution on grounds that it would aggravate the situation by "adding fuel to the fire".In all, 93 countries voted in favour, 24 against while 58 abstained. This met the two-thirds majority benchmark in which only the voting members, not abstentions, are counted from the 193-member General Assembly. As a result, Russia now stands suspended from the 47-member Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council.Libya was the last country to be suspended in 2011 because of violence by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi against angry protestors. This resolution against Russia followed reports of massacre of 300 people in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv.Territorial Integrity, Sovereignty' Absent in Statement The resolution adopted on Thursday expressed "grave concern" at the violation of human rights in Ukraine and condemned Russia for carrying out attacks against civilians while claiming to the world that these were "special military operations".For its part, India in its Explanation of Vote expressed dissatisfaction with the process followed for suspension even as it condemned civilian killings in Bucha. Interestingly India's statement on Thursday had no mention of the issue of territorial integrity and sovereignty. This is the first time in the last two months that India has omitted this part.
