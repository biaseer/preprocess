Ukraine acknowledged on Friday it was taking heavy losses in Russia's assault in the east, but said Russia's losses were even worse, as US President Joe Biden called on Congress to send as much as $33 billion to help Kyiv withstand the attack.The body of a journalist from US-backed broadcaster Radio Liberty was found in rubble in the Ukrainian capital, killed in a Russian missile attack during a visit by the UN secretary-general.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised Biden's offer of help, which is 10 times the aid Washington has sent since Feb. 24. Having failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas.Ukraine has acknowledged losing control of some towns and villages there since the assault began last week, but says Moscow's gains have come at a massive cost to a Russian force already worn down from its earlier defeat near the capital. "We have serious losses but the Russians' losses are much much bigger...They have colossal losses," presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said.The United States and its allies are now sending heavy weapons including artillery, with what Washington says is an aim not just to repel Russia's attack but to weaken its armed forces so it cannot menace its neighbours again.RECOMMENDEDSTORIES FOR YOURussia warns West: Don't test our patienceRussia strikes Kyiv during UN chief's visit as Moscow presses offensiveUN head condemns attacks on civilians during Ukraine visit"We need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom," Biden said.

We defend common values - democracy and freedom. We appreciate the help. Today it is needed more than ever!"
