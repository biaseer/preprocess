PUNE: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has resulted in prices of branded sunflower oil touching the highest mark so far  almost Rs3,000 per can of 15 litres.The price in terms of per litre of sunflower oil is in the range of Rs170-Rs190 as against Rs140-Rs150 three months ago, officials at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee as well as wholesale traders at the Gultekdi market yard said.Last year, the highest price for a 15ltr can of branded sunflower oil was Rs2,400, but the ongoing war has badly impacted the import from Russia and Ukraine and the same has led to demand-supply mismatch and price rise. The price of refined sunflower oil in the local markets is in the range of Rs2,650-Rs3,100 per 15 litres.India imports over 70 of sunflower oil from Russia and Ukraine. The supply has been hampered severely due to the tension between the two countries. There is no adequate supply from Indian producers. The halt in supplies of sunflower oil has resulted in a demand surge on other variety of cooking oil such as palm, groundnut and soybean, which are witnessing a demand-supply mismatch over the last few months, said Raikumar Nahar, an oil trader at Gultekdi Market Yard.Sachin Nivangune, president, grocery association of Pune district, said, The prices of a litre of soybean, groundnut and palm oil are selling in the range of Rs130-Rs170 at local markets in the city, said Nivangune. Nitin Raskar, head, grocery, Market Yard, said, Shortage of oilseeds and groundnut has impacted production in local markets. Local oil producers are unable to meet the existing demand-supply gap. BV Mehta, executive director, Solvent Extractors Association of India, said, The prices may come down as the harvest of soybean and mustard is good and local oil producers may supply oil in good quantities in the coming days.
