NEW DELHI: With the UN Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss Russia's claims that US was helping Ukraine manufacture biological weapons, India reiterated there is no other alternative to resolve the situation than the path to diplomacy and dialogue and again stressed the need to respect sovereignty and territorial integrity.Indian ambassador T S Tirumurti said India had noted the recent statements by "states and wider information regarding biological activities relating to Ukraine". In this context, he added, India would like to underline the importance it attached to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention BTWC as a key global and non-discriminatory disarmament Convention, prohibiting an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. It is important to ensure full and effective implementation of the BTWC in letter and spirit, said Tirumurti. "We also believe that any matter relating to obligations under the BTWC should be addressed as per the provisions of the Convention, and through consultation and cooperation between the parties concerned," said the ambassador. The UNSC meeting was held at Russia's request. The US said Russia asked for the meet for "purpose of lying and spreading misinformation" and that the US wasn't supporting any Ukrainian biological weapon laboratory anywhere in the world."We have repeatedly expressed serious concern over the ongoing situation in Ukraine. We sincerely hope the ongoing direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine would lead to cessation of hostilities. The dire humanitarian situation needs immediate and urgent attention. We once again call upon member states to adhere to the principles of the UN Charter and international law and respect the sovereignty and integrity of states," he added.
