WASHINGTON: US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Sunday he does not expect breakthroughs in US-Russia security talks this week but hopes to find some common ground amid a crisis in Ukraine. I dont think were going to see any breakthroughs in the coming week, he told CNN.Were going to be able to put things on the table. Russians will do the same... and well see if there are grounds for moving forward, Blinken said. He said any progress would depend on actions from both sides in negotiations that Washington hopes will avert prospects for a new Russian invasion of Ukraine.Any movement to resolve the issues, he said, will have to happen on a reciprocal basis. Blinkens comments lowering expectations for the upcoming talks echoed Russias hard line on Sunday that it wouldnt make any concessions under US pressure at talks this week on the Ukraine crisis. He stressed that progress would be difficult, if not impossible, amid Moscows military buildup at its border with Ukraine. To make progress, its very hard to see that happening when theres an ongoing escalation, he said.
