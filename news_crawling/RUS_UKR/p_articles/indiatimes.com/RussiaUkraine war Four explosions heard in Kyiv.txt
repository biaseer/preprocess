Four explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv early Sunday, with AFP journalists reporting a residential complex near the centre of the city had been hit, causing a fire and cloud of grey smoke. The blasts occurred around 6:30 am 0330 GMT, half an hour after air raid sirens sounded in the capital, which has not not come under Russian bombardment for nearly three weeks. There was no immediate information on casualties. An AFP colleague living in the same residential complex heard a loud buzz preceding the explosions. "Several explosions in the Shevchenkivsky district," Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. "Ambulances and rescuers are on site. In two buildings, the rescue and evacuation of residents is underway," he added. Thick smoke was seen in the affected residential area, which was cordoned off by police. At the end of April, a Ukrainian journalist from Radio Liberty was killed in her apartment by a Russian strike on Kyiv during a visit by UN chief Antonio Guterres.
