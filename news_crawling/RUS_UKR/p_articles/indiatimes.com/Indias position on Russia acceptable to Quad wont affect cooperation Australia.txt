NEW DELHI: While Australian PM Scott Morrison has said he will raise with his counterpart Narendra Modi Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an issue that dominated Japan's agenda with India in the summit Saturday, Australia seems to have taken a more understanding view of India's "balanced" position which apparently allows it to reach out to both sides to foster dialogue and diplomacy.Ahead of the virtual summit on Monday, the Australian high commissioner here Barry OFarrell said Quad countries have accepted India's position and that it wasn't going to affect cooperation among them. This is significant as both the US and Japan have been asking India to take a more strident position on Russia in the Security Council.Australia is expected to announce investment worth Rs 1500 crore during the summit on Monday, described by a diplomatic source as largest ever by Australia in India, in areas like space, clean technology and also in critical minerals where Australia is looking to challenge Chinas control of the international market. Following the summit, the 2 countries are also expected to sign an early harvest or interim trade agreement by the end of this month. With growing strategic proximity, India and Australia also seem close to clinching the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, which they have been negotiating for the past 12 years, in late 2022.Asked about Indias position on Ukraine, OFarrell said Quad had accepted Indias position and that each of the Quad countries had their own bilateral relationship with Russia and their own perspectives. We know that PM Modi has called for an end to the conflict and nobody should be unhappy with that, said the high commissioner. Morrison was quoted as saying on Friday that the Ukraine situation and its implications for the Indo-Pacific and Myanmar will figure in his talks with Modi. He had said ties with India are based on mutual understanding and trust, a commitment to democracy, and a shared vision of an open, inclusive, resilient and prosperous Indo-Pacific.Australia sees Indias decision to abstain from voting on UN resolutions condemning Russia as in line with Indias first PM Jawaharlal Nehrus policies on similar issues. Recalling Indias no-condemnation policy of the past, a throwback perhaps to Nehrus refusal to condemn the Soviet Unions handling of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, a source said India has always worked to create space for dialogue and engagement and that even now nobody has accused India of supporting whats going on in Ukraine.In the summit with Modi on Saturday, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida had strongly taken up Russias invasion of Ukraine and sought Modis cooperation in ensuring President Vladimir Putin follows what the Japanese described as a free and open international order. While Morrison has threatened China with sanctions for any possible attempt to back Russia, he has been more discreet when faced with queries about Indias position. Asked about Indias refusal to condemn Russias action, Morrison said last month all countries have different levels of engagement with Russia and hes respectful of that.
