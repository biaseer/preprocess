By Prakash V LAfter prices of petrol and diesel were hiked by the government, now beer makers are raising the prices of the alcohol beverage. In the past two years, due to covid-19 pandemic, most beer companies did not increase the prices, but due to rise in input prices like barley, diesel, and petrol, the price hike is inevitable.Most beer manufacturing companies requested the Excise department to increase per bottle price by Rs 5 to Rs 10. The revised prices will be implemented from April 15 for most of the companies, say sources. Most of the beer brands selling canned beer, 330ml and 650 ml bottles will see a price hike.The price hike is directly linked to the Russia and Ukraine war. The main ingredient for beer production is Barley, which was imported from Russia and Ukraine. The ongoing war between the countries led to a reduction in supply of the barley, which eventually led to the rise in its price. The price of yeast and other raw materials also rose. Added to this, the fuel price hike resulted in an increase in logistics.Web indenting, which was introduced in Karnataka State Beverages Corporation Limited KSBCL was not implemented properly and created a crisis for wholesale suppliers of liquor. A liquor retailer said KSBCL is not supplying liquor from April 2. Due to the Ugadi festival last week, most retailers sold their stock. Very little stock is left. The remaining stock also closes by Tuesday.Karnataka Wine Merchants Association conducted a protest, demanding the resumption of the earlier system of supplying liquor from KSBCL. A retailer said, We have requested to keep the old system along with a new system of indenting for at least one month. But, our request was not considered.
