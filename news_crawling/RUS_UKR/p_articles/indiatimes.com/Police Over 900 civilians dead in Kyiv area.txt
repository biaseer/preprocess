The bodies of more than 900 civilians were discovered in the Kyiv region following the withdrawal of Russian forces, the regional police chief said in a briefing Friday. Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv's regional police force, said the bodies had been abandoned in the streets or given temporary burials. He cited police data indicating that 95 of the casualties had died from sniper fire and gunshot wounds. "Consequently, we understand that under the Russian occupation, people were simply executed in the streets," Nebytov said. "The number of killed civilians has surpassed 900 - and I emphasize, these are civilians, whose bodies we have discovered and handed over for forensic examination." He added that more bodies were being found every day, under the rubble and in mass graves. "The most victims were found in Bucha, where there are more than 350 corpses," he said.
