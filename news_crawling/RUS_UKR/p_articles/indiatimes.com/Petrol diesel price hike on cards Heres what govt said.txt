Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday said oil companies will determine the fuel prices and assured that there will be no shortage of crude oil in the country."I assure you all that there will be no shortage of crude oil. We will make sure that our energy requirements are met, even though 85 per cent of our requirements are dependent on imports for crude oil and 50-55 per cent on gas," Puri said at a press conference.There have been speculations that petrol and diesel prices may start to rise after the release of state elections results later this week.
