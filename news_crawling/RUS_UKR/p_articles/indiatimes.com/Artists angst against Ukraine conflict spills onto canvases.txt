Vadodara: Anguished by the violence that has ravaged many homes and killed hundreds in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, a group of Vadodara artists have come together to voice their concern through Art Against War, over the mindless bloodshed and destructions. Art is hope. Through their works, the artists have expressed their wish to have peace and save humanity, Aditya Vikram, who has curated the show, told TOI.The art exhibition inaugurated on Friday is being organised at the Faculty of Fine Arts in MS University by Shimeesha Art Studio. The exhibition on the theme of war displays the chaos the war brought upon the people and how peace is important in these times. About 40 paintings and eight sculptures have been kept on display in the exhibition. Creativity and art has always been against war. There is so much conflict and violence which is against humanity. We wanted to express our disagreement to the violence in the Russia-Ukraine war so we organized this exhibition, said Vikram.Works of veteran artists like K G Subramanyan, Gulam Mohammed Sheikh, Jeram Patel, Jyoti Bhatt, Bhupen Khakhar and Jayanti Rabadia have been kept on display apart from many other prominent artists from fine arts faculty. Many of the artists have chosen to paint Mahatma Gandhi who was considered to be an apostle of peace. While some have filled the canvas with a range of bright colours expressing hope and joy, one of the artists has painted an isolated house ravaged during the war. The exhibition will be on display till March 13.
