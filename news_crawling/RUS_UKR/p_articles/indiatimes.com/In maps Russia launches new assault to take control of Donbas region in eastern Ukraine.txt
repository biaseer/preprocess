NEW DELHI: Russia hurled its military might against Ukrainian cities and towns and poured more troops into the war, seeking to slice the country in two in a potentially pivotal battle for control of the eastern industrial heartland of coal mines and factories.Russia has intensified assaults on eastern Ukrainian cities and towns along a front hundreds of miles long in what officials on both sides described as a new phase of the war.Here's what you need to know about the new phase of Russia's war:New strategyThe fighting has unfolded along a boomerang-shaped front hundreds of miles long in what is known as the Donbas. If successful, it would give President Vladimir Putin a victory following the failed attempt by Moscow's forces to storm the capital, Kyiv, and heavier-than-expected casualties.1. Main effort Eastern Ukraine  Russian forces began a new offensive in eastern Ukraine likely to capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.2. Supporting effort Kharkiv and Izyum Russian objective is likely to advance southeast to support Russian operations in the Luhansk region.3. Supporting effort Southern axisRussian objected to defend Kherson against Ukrainian counterattacks.4. Supporting effort Sumy and northeastern Ukraine  Russian objective to withdraw combat power for redeployment to eastern Ukraine.In Mariupol, the devastated port city in the Donbas, Ukrainian troops said the Russian military dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of a sprawling steel plant  believed to be the defenders' last holdout  and hit a hospital where hundreds were staying.The Ukrainian General Staff said that Russia was continuing to mount offensives at various locations in the east as its forces probe for weak points in the Ukrainian lines. The General Staff said in a statement that defeating the last resistance in the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol remains Russias top priority.Key to the Russian campaign is the capture of Mariupol, which would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, seized from Ukraine in 2014. It would also free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas.The eastern cities of Kharkiv and Kramatorsk also came under deadly attack. Russia said it struck areas around Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro west of the Donbas with missiles.Both sides have described the assault that began on Monday as a new phase of the war.Ukraine war refugees top 5 millionWith the war in Ukraine approaching eight weeks, more than 5 million people have fled the country since Russian troops invaded on February 24, the UN refugee agency reported on Wednesday. When the number reached 4 million on March 30, the exodus exceeded the worst-case predictions of the Geneva-based UN High Commissioner for Refugees.Ukraine had a pre-war population of 44 million, and UNHCR says the conflict has displaced more than 7 million people within Ukraine along with the 5.03 million who had left as of Wednesday. According to the agency, 13 million people are believed to be trapped in the war-affected areas of Ukraine.Nuclear power plantsAbout half of Ukraines electricity is generated from 15 reactors with most of its nuclear services and fuel imported from Russia.Russian forces have seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in eastern Ukraine, the largest nuclear plant in Europe. The US Embassy in Ukraine called the Russian assault on the Zaporizhzhia plant a war crime. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said it showed how reckless the Russian invasion has been.Russian forces seized the Chernobyl power plant at the beginning of the invasion and withdrew on March 31. The International Atomic Energy Agency on Wednesday said direct phone communications between the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant and Ukraines nuclear regulator have been restored.Breakaway regionsRussia on Wednesday said that it has started a new stage of its 'special military operation' in Ukraine and intends to "completely liberate" the territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics -- - collectively known as the Donbas. The announcement was made by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had stated during his overnight video address that the "battle for Donbas" had begun.Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions broke away from Ukrainian government control in 2014 and proclaimed themselves independent peoples republics. On February 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognising the two breakaway regions as independent entities.NATO deployments in EuropeIn response to Russias actions, Nato allies have activated defence plans, deployed elements of the NATO Response Force, and placed 40,000 troops in the eastern part of the Alliance, along with significant air and naval assets, under direct NATO command supported by Allies national deployments. NATO is also establishing four multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups will extend all along NATOs eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.With inputs from agencies Maps credit: Reuters
