Acknowledging strategic partnership between India and Russia, Sviatoslav Yurash, Ukraine's youngest Member of Parliament on Wednesday asserted that in light of the Ukraine crisis India needs to reconsider its position on Moscow. "As far as India-Russia is concerned, you have a treaty on strategic friendship and partnership, I think that needs to be reconsidered in light of not just Ukraine but all misdeeds that Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime has been doing for the last 20 years. Russia needs to be punished by India," he said. He praised India for the humanitarian measures.
