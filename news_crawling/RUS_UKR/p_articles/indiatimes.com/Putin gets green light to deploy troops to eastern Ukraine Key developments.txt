NEW DELHI: The Ukraine crisis further deepened with Russian President Vladimir Putin recognising the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic as independent states and getting permission from his lawmakers to use military force outside the country. He acted in defiance of Western warnings that such a step would be illegal and kill any possibility of peace negotiations.At a UNSC emergency meeting, India called for restraint while urging all Indian students and nationals in Ukraine to leave the country immediately. The first Air India flight from Kyiv to Delhi is enroute with 242 passengers on board. Two more flights are scheduled for February 24 and 26. Here are the key developments on the Ukraine crisis through the day:Lawmakers give Putin permission to use force outside RussiaRussian lawmakers gave President Vladimir Putin permission to use military force outside the country on Tuesday - a move that could presage a broader attack on Ukraine after the US said an invasion was already underway there.Several European leaders said earlier in the day that Russian troops have moved into rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine after Putin recognized their independence. But it was unclear how large the movements were, and Ukraine and its Western allies have said Russian troops have been fighting in the region since the separatist conflict erupted in 2014. Moscow denies those allegations.Members of the upper house, the Federation Council, voted unanimously to allow Putin to use military force outside Russia - effectively formalizing a Russian military deployment to the rebel regions, where an eight-year conflict has killed nearly 14,000 people.Russia recognises rebel-held regions, moves in troopsRussia moved quickly Tuesday to secure its hold on Ukraine's rebel regions following the recognition of their independence. It also introduced legislations in parliament allowing the deployment of troops there. The new Russian bills, which are set to be quickly rubber-stamped by the Kremlin-controlled parliament, may set the stage for Russian troops to move deeper into Ukraine as the US and its allies have feared.Putin announced the move in a televised speech, blaming the US and its allies for the current crisis and describing Ukraine's bid to join Nato as an existential challenge to Russia.Several hours later, he issued an order for the Russian army to send troops as "peacekeepers" to east Ukraine.Russia on Tuesday called on other countries to "follow" it in recognising east Ukraine's separatist republics. Putin's move formalises Russia's hold on the regions and gives it a free hand to deploy its forces there.EU sanctions Russian individuals, entitiesEuropean Union foreign ministers agreed on Tuesday to sanction 27 Russians and entities after Moscow recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, as well banks, the defence sector and limiting Russian access to European capital markets.All members of Russia's Duma, parliament's lower house, will be hit with EU sanctions, which typically involve travel bans and asset freezes."This package of sanctions that has been approved by unanimity by the member states will hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told a news conference alongside France's foreign minister at a meeting in Paris.US responds with sanctionsSoon after Russia recognising independence of Ukraine's rebel-held regions, White House issued an executive order to prohibit US investment and trade in the regions, and additional sanctions likely to be announced on Tuesday.Those sanctions are independent of what Washington has prepared in the event of a Russian invasion, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.Ukraine on Tuesday urged its Western allies to hit Russia with "tough sanctions."Read AlsoExplainer: What is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline?It's a 1,230-kilometer-long 764-mile-long natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, running from Russia to Germany's Baltic coast. The undersea pipeline directly links Russian gas to Europe via Germany and is complete but not yet operating.Germany suspends Nord Stream 2 gas pipelineGermany has taken steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday, as the West started taking punitive measures against Moscow over the Ukraine crisis. The decision, which was criticised by Moscow, is a significant move for the German government.Scholz said his government made the decision in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine that he said marked a "serious break of international law"."Now it's up to the international community to react to this one-sided, incomprehensible and unjustified action by the Russian president," he told reporters in Berlin, adding that it was necessary to "send a clear signal to Moscow that such actions won't remain without consequences".Up to now, Berlin had long resisted pulling the plug on the project, despite strong pressure from the United States and some European countries to do so. Washington has for years also argued that building another pipeline bringing natural gas from Russia to Germany - especially one that bypasses Ukraine - increases Europe's reliance on Russian energy supplies.US officials have also warned that Nord Stream 2 poses risks to Ukraine and Poland because it could allow Russia to stop pumping gas through those countries.Scholz predecessor Angela Merkel had defended the project, as have prominent figures in Scholz's center-left Social Democratic Party.Read AlsoWhite House calls Russian moves on Ukraine an invasionThe White House on Tuesday began referring to Russian troop deployments in eastern Ukraine as an "invasion" after initially hesitating to use the term - a red line that President Joe Biden has said would result in the US levying severe sanctions against Moscow.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba praised Germany for suspending certification of the pipeline."This is a morally, politically and practically correct step in the current circumstances," he wrote on Twitter. "True leadership means tough decisions in difficult times. Germany's move proves just that."But Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev, slammed the German government's decision to halt certification of the pipeline."Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay 2,000 euros for 1.000 cubic meters of natural gas!" said Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia's Security Council.UK unveils sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchsBritain on Tuesday slapped sanctions on five Russian banks and three billionaires, in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson called "the first barrage" of measures in response to the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine.Addressing the UK parliament hours after Russia ordered troops into two Moscow-backed Ukrainian rebel regions, Johnson described it as "a renewed invasion" of its western neighbour and "pretext for a full-scale offensive"."The UK and our allies will begin to impose the sanctions on Russia that we have already prepared... to sanction Russian individuals and entities of strategic importance to the Kremlin," he told MPs.The British leader said further sanctions were "at readiness to be deployed" if the Kremlin showed further aggression in what he predicted would be "a protracted crisis".The five banks targeted -- Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank -- and three people sanctioned will see any UK assets frozen.The individuals concerned -- Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg -- will be banned from travelling to Britain and all UK individuals and entities will be banned from dealing with them and the banks.Read AlsoBritain publishes full list of Russia sanctionsLONDON: Britain published sanctions against five banks and three individuals on Tuesday, part of a package of measures in response to Russia's recognition of two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine as independent.
