Many international sanctions have been imposed on Russia in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. At the same time, domestic restrictions have also multiplied. As an Indian citizen living in Moscow, I experienced the effect of the sanctions and other restrictions firsthand. On 24 February 2022, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, everything seemed alright in the capital. However, the situation started to change after about a week. The first noticeable change was when euros and dollars stopped coming into the country. Visa and Mastercard services were suspended. As the rouble swung wildly, I noticed that it remained marked as 70 cents per dollar at exchange rate counters, as if to hide the true picture.
