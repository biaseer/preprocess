Russian officials on Thursday dismissed the visit by the leaders of France, Germany and Italy to Kyiv as empty symbolism, and argued that Western arms deliveries would only prolong the fighting. Dmitri Medvedev, the Russian ex-president who is vice chairman of President Putins Security Council, disparaged the three leaders as European connoisseurs of frogs, liverwurst and pasta.  He gave his assessment on Twitter of how things would play out: They promised EU membership again and old howitzers, had some Ukrainian vodka shots and took the train home, like 100 years ago.  He added, Its just that this doesnt bring Ukraine any closer to peace. And the clock is ticking  Russian officials insist they will achieve their war aims no matter how many weapons Ukraine receives. Earlier, Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlins spokesman, had said he hoped that the EU leaders would not only concentrate on supporting Ukraine via pumping it full of weapons. This is pointless and will only extend peoples suffering. . . Instead, well hope that they will use their contacts to move President Zelensky toward looking at the real state of things.
