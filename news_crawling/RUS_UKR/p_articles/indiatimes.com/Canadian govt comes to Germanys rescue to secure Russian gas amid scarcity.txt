The Canadian government has decided to keep aside its own restrictions by returning crucial equipment, needed for maintenance on the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, to Russia via Germany, despite criticism and pressure from Ukraine.Canadian Minister of Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson announced the move on Saturday evening, insisting it would guarantee Europes ability to access reliable and affordable energy as they continue to transition away from Russian oil and gas.The decision follows Berlin's request to Ottawa to return Russian gas pipeline components amid a rising energy shortage. In the meantime, according to Reuters and Ukrainian news outlets, the government in Kiev was pressuring Canada not to return the equipment, arguing that the precedent would erode anti-Russia sanctions.Explaining its decision, the Canadian government said that absent a necessary supply of natural gas, the German economy will suffer very significant hardship and Germans themselves will be at risk of being unable to heat their homes as winter approaches.Last month, Russian gas monopoly Gazprom reduced the flow through the Nord Stream pipeline to 40 of capacity, citing operational risks after the equipment, built in Canada by Siemens, was sent to Montreal for maintenance but was blocked from being returned on time.On Friday, Moscow said gas supplies to Europe would be increased if the turbine was returned. However, on July 11, Gazprom is set to close Nord Stream for 10 days for scheduled maintenance. During that time, all gas flows via the pipeline will stop.The dispute comes amid a broader standoff between Russia and the EU, with Brussels trying to wean the bloc off Russian energy in an attempt to decrease its reliance on the sanctions-hit nation.
