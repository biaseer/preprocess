WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said Thursday that the United States will not let Russia use "gas blackmail" to pressure European allies and to undermine sanctions placed on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine."We will not let Russia intimidate or blackmail their way out of these sanctions. We will not allow them to use their oil and gas to avoid consequences for their aggression," Biden said.Russia, under international pressure over its war in Ukraine, on Wednesday cut off gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, both EU and NATO members."There is an element of Russia shooting itself in the foot," Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee."The revenues and resources that it would get from the sale it will be denied."Blinken also pointed to ramped-up US shipments of liquified natural gas to Europe "to help compensate for any shortfalls including those that may result from Russia trying to use this as a tool of blackmail."Germany in particular has faced criticism that it emboldened Russia through reliance on its gas.
