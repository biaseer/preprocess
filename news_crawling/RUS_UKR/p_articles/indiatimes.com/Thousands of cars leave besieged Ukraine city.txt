KYIV: The city council of Mariupol says that some 2,000 civilian cars have managed to leave the besieged Ukrainian port city via a so-called humanitarian corridor leading west.The council said another 2,000 cars are in the city but waiting to leave along the route, which runs for more than 260 kilometers to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia.Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on social media the corridor would be open from 8 pm local time Tuesday to 7 am Thursday.The council advised drivers to spend the night somewhere along the route rather than drive straight through, unless they are already close to Zaporizhzhia by evening.It was not immediately clear if the total number of cars which had left was for Tuesday only, or if it included 160 cars which left the day before.The city council said nearly 300 people had arrived in Zaporizhzhia as of Tuesday morning, fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
