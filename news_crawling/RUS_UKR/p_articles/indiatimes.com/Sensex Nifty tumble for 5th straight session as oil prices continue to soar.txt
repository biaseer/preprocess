NEW DELHI: Domestic benchmark indices on Tuesday fell for the fifth straight session amid a surge in crude prices globally, even as exit poll results suggesting a BJP victory in the just concluded UP elections kept the downside fairly capped.The third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine in Belarus could not yield a positive outcome, but Russia declared a ceasefire in five Ukrainian cities to provide humanitarian corridors.On the other hand, it warned that the West could face oil prices of over $300 per barrel it follows through on threats to cut energy supplies from Russia. Crude prices were ruling $126 a barrel earlier today."The heightened volatility in the market continues. Even though the market is now oversold, sentiments are negative. The positive development from the market perspective is the exit poll projection of BJP doing well in UP. Declining bond yields in the US and the possibility of lower-than-feared rate hikes by the Fed are reliefs from the market perspective. IT, energy, metals and pharma continue to be the safe bets in the present context," said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.At 9.20 am, the BSE Sensex was trading at 52,790.03, down 52.72 points or 0.10 per cent.
