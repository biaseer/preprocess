As the war in Ukraine drags, there is increased pressure on India to clarify its ambivalent position of 'strategic autonomy'. With shifting sands in the world order continuing, as a growing power straddling the world of developed and developing economies, India needs to find its place in this rework-in-progress.India's position is complicated - at least as complicated as the messiness 'out there'. The latest events in Pakistan are a reminder of Rawalpindi running Islamabad. A rupture in the New Delhi-Moscow relationship could clear the way for a Russia-China-Pakistan partnership. Russia wants to bind India - the offer of heavily discounted Ural-grade fuel is a way to tip the scales of India's strategic autonomy. China continues to attempt to push the 'Asia vs the world' narrative to isolate India from the West. India must emphasise its spot in a complicated 'splattered Earth' scenario during its engagements with Western powers.S Jaishankar's 'six principles' put India in Ukraine's corner - dealing with a powerful neighbour with designs on their territory. Not pulling its punches, New Delhi has told Moscow to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries. A continued Vladimir Putin-Joe Biden face-off will serve to make Russia weaker vis-a-vis China. A stronger China not being desirable for India and the world, Narendra Modi must leverage India's neutrality to nudge Putin to end the war and opt for dialogue. As the war's human toll rises, India's strategic autonomy feels more like opportunism. Accepting that trade-offs are inescapable, India must shed its post-colonial, Cold War-era mindset, rooting its response in its commitment to democracy, open societies and partnerships for prosperity - without overtly falling into camps.
