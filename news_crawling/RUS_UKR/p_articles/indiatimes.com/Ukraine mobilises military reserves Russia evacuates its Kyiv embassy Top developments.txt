NEW DELHI: Western sanctions seem to have little effect on Russia, as it continues to bolster military presence near Ukraine's border. Russian President Putin said the doors of diplomacy are still open, however, there can be no compromise on Russia's security. Meanwhile, Ukraine is planning to impose a 30-day state of emergency apart from Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while calling for tighter sanctions on Russia.Here are some of the major developments through the day:Russia begins evacuating diplomatic staff from KyivRussia began evacuating diplomatic staff from Ukraine, a day after lawmakers in Moscow granted President Vladimir Putin permission to use force abroad.Moscow's foreign ministry announced Tuesday it would evacuate diplomats from the country soon, saying this was in order to "protect their lives".The Russian flag was lowered over the embassy's building, according to eyewitnesses.Some Western embassies, including the United States and Britain, moved their staff to the city of Lviv near the Polish border.They did so fearing a Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying the capital could come under attack.Russia continues military build-up on Ukraine's bordersSatellite images show a new deployment of more than 100 military vehicles and dozens of troop tents in southern Belarus near the Ukraine border, Maxar Technologies, a private US company said on Tuesday.The images also showed a new field hospital has been added to a military garrison in western Russia close to the border with Ukraine.Heavy equipment transporters, used for moving tanks, artillery and other heavy equipment, were seen near the Ukraine border in western Russia, as well as several new deployments of troops, according to Maxar.Ukraine calls up reservists, allows civilians to carry firearmsUkraine's parliament has voted to approve a draft law which gives permission to Ukrainians to carry firearms and act in self-defence."The adoption of this law is fully in the interests of the state and society," the authors of the draft law said in a note, adding that the law was needed due to "existing threats and dangers for the citizens of Ukraine".This comes on a day when Ukraine also declared a 30-day national emeregncy.The parliament also approved sanctions against 351 Russians, including lawmakers who supported recognising the independence of two separatist-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine and the deployment of Russian troops there.Ukraine began calling up reservists into the armed forces and urged its citizens to leave Russia immediately. Its armed forces said in a statement on Facebook that reservists between the ages of 18 and 60 would be called up for a period of up to one year.Ukraine has a reserve force of more than 200,000 that is comprised mostly of military personnel who served in the first years of the country's eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists.No Biden-Putin meet for now, White House saysWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said that a proposed meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin "certainly is not in the plans" anymore after the latter's decision to declare the rebel regions in Ukraine as independent states and push more troops towards Kiev.Psaki did not explicitly rule out a meeting in the future but said Biden would not meet Putin unless Russia de-escalates the situation in Ukraine by pulling back troops.Russia open to diplomacy but won't compromise on security: PutinPresident Vladimir Putin said that Russia was always open to diplomacy but put its own national security interests first and would continue to strengthen its military in the face of what he called a difficult international situation."We can see the difficult international situation and the threats posed by current challenges, such as the erosion of the arms control system and NATOs military activities," said Putin."And yet, Russias appeals to build a system based on equal and indivisible security that would reliably defend all countries, remain unanswered."Russia hit with barrage of sanctionsUS sanctions target Russian elites and two state-owned banks, excluding them from the US banking system, banning them from trading with Americans, and freezing their US assets.They also seek to deny the Russian government access to Western financing.The US sanctions applied to VEB bank and Russia's military bank, Promsvyazbank, which does defence deals. Russia's two largest commercial lenders, Sberbank and VTB, would face American sanctions if Moscow proceeded with its invasion of Ukraine, a US official said.Japan too said it will impose sanctions on Russia and individuals linked to Ukrainian regions controlled by pro-Kremlin separatists.However Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov brushed off the threat of sanctions."Our European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called punishment of Russia," he said.Roots of Ukraine crisis in post-Soviet politics: JaishankarThe situation in Ukraine has its roots in post-Soviet politics, the expansion of NATO and the dynamics between Russia and Europe, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said."The situation in Ukraine is the result of a complex chain of circumstances over the last 30 years. Most countries, such as India and France, which are very active, are seeking a diplomatic solution," he said."The real question is: are you mobilised to find a good solution or are you content with posturing? India can talk with Russia, with other countries, within the UN security council and support initiatives like those of France," Jaishankar said.India ties will not be affected, Russia hopesAmid turmoil in its ties with western nations triggered by the Ukraine crisis, Russia on Wednesday expresses hopes that its relations with India will remain unaffected."We hope our partnership will continue further at the same level which we are enjoying today, especially have a look at outcomes of recent Russian-Indian bilateral summit in Dec 2021," Roman Babushkin, Russian Embassy's Deputy Chief of Mission in Delhi said."On the sidelines, we've signed the program of 10 years cooperation in the defence area. We have a lot of big projects in the pipeline  we have full confidence that all our plans will be successfully implemented," he added.Air India flight brings back 242 from UkraineAir India flight brings back 242 from Ukraine An Air India flight with 242 passengers landed in New Delhi from Kyiv late last night. This was the first of the three flights the airline will operate this week to fly Indians out of Ukraine. Majority of the passengers on Tuesday's flight were students. The Indian embassy in Kyiv said yesterday that an Ukrainian airline will operate four flights from Kyiv to Delhi in the coming days.
