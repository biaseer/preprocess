Nottinghamshire Live reported in March that Russian has taken similar action against US President Joe Biden.
The BBC is also reported that Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and 10 other senior politicians have also been barred in retaliation to the UK's sanctions against it since it invaded Ukraine.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is also listed, along with former Prime Minister Theresa May, who authorised sanctions after the Salisbury poison incident in 2018.
In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the shelling of a residential area killed seven people, including a seven-month-old child, and wounded 34, according to regional governor Oleh Sinehubov.
Russian forces continued preparations for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine, and fighting also went on in the pummelled southern port city of Mariupol, where locals reported seeing Russian troops digging up bodies.
Russia has banned Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior ministers from entering the country, according to reports. The BBC is reporting that Russia has taken the stance over what it describes as the UK's "hostile" stance on the war in Ukraine.
It comes as Moscow has threatened to mount renewed missile attacks on Kyiv, where authorities said the bodies of more than 900 civilians were found outside the capital.
Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement: "In connection with the unprecedented hostile actions of the British government, expressed, in particular, in the imposition of sanctions against top officials of the Russian Federation, a decision was made to include key members of the British government and a number of political figures in the Russian 'stop list'."
