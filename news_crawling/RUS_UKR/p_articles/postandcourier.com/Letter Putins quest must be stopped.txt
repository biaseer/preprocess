Vladimir Putin is starting to show his true colors. That is, his aspirations to be on the Top 10 List of World Conquerors with members such as Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Adolf Hitler and others. In the last seven years, Russia, under Putin's leadership, has seized control of the Republic of Crimea, the Luhansk People's Republic, the Donetsk People's Republic and now Ukraine in process. However, as the war in Ukraine intensifies, Putin better wake up and smell the roses. Im sure he would rather spend the rest of his life in todays world as opposed to a post-nuclear war world.
