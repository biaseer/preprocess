Speaking before the vote, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, compared the Russian invasion to the Nazi conquest ofEurope.
The only countries to vote no in support of Moscow were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. Longstanding allies Cuba and Nicaragua joined China in abstaining.
South Sudan is among other UN member countries abstained from voting on the call for Russia to unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine.
In an emergency session of the UNs general assembly, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained, and five voted against.
The United Nations has voted overwhelmingly fora resolutiondeploring Russias invasion ofUkraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces.
The resolution said the UN deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine.
It demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces.
A few of the eldest Ukrainians and Russians might recall a moment like this, a moment when one aggressive European nation invaded another without provocation to claim the territory of its neighbor, a moment when a European dictator declared he would return his empire to its former glory and invasion that caused a war so horrific, that it spurred this organization into existence, Thomas-Greenfield said.
The resolution is not legally binding, but is an expression of the views of the UN membership, aimed at increasing pressure on Moscow and its ally, Belarus.
