One viewer wrote on Twitter: "Is this the start of Putin's cyber attack on Britain?"
To make up for the disruption, the local news for London at 1.55pm has been replaced by an ITV News Meridian bulletin.
However, according to ITV meteorologist Chris Page, the incident was caused by a power cut in the production gallery.
It left some ITV viewers speculating over whether the awkward on-air crash could be linked.
He quickly informed people on Twitter: "National News Gallery seemed to have a power cut just now on ITV - don't worry. Local news coming up shortly!"
What should have been the regular lunchtime news was replaced with an error screen apologising for the 'disruption'.
