STEPANAKERT, AUGUST 5, ARTSAKHPRESS:"I think that if you live on the Donbass territory today, which is temporarily occupied, and you think that our cause is right, we need to be with Russia, we are Russian, then it is a big mistake to remain living in Donbass, it will never become Russian territory. Never. It doesnt matter for how long it has been occupied, its like that wall that used to be in Germany," he said. In relation to that, the head of state asserted that "for the sake of your children and grandchildren it is already time to go find a place for yourself in the Russian Federation." According to him, "there wont be a civilization without Ukraine" on the Donbass territory.
At the same time, the Ukrainian president addressed Ukrainians in Donbass and expressed confidence that the region will return as part of Ukraine. "If you feel that youre Ukrainian and you respect the Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian language, even if they didnt teach you at school. Read books on your own. If you feel that youre Ukrainian, be there. This land will be de-occupied," he asserted.
