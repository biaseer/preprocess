The senator left for Ukraine in late June and has since been updating Channel 8 weekly on the conditions and climate of the war-torn nation. Brewer says the lack of supplies, weapons, and equipment he expected to see hasnt come.
LINCOLN, Neb. KLKN- Sen. Tom Brewer said hes waiting on NATO to give Ukrainians the life-saving resources they need to win the war against Russia.
Theres probably been about another 300 cruise missiles, bombs, rockets impacting, you know the general eastern part of the country, he said. Its something thats a little nerve-wracking because you never know where its gonna hit.
I think its critical that this war needs to end as soon as possible, I think its going to require a lot more commitment from NATO to provide more weapons.
With hopes the war could end soon, Brewer continues his mission with a call to action to the worlds military allies.
NATO is slow rolling a lot of this equipment in and they need to get their act together because theyre killing Ukrainians every day because they dont have the weapons to fight this war like they need to, Brewer said.
Brewer emphasized that as NATO continues to drag its feet to get Ukraine supplies, as it becomes more difficult to travel through towns.
