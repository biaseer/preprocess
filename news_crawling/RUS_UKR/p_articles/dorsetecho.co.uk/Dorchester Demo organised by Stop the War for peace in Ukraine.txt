Ms German argued that peace in Ukraine would require not only the withdrawal of Russian troops but, also, an end to NATO expansion. Members also heard that the war in Ukraine should not be used as an excuse for more fossil fuel extraction, such as the mooted oil well at Puddletown.
DORSET Stop the War is to take part in an international day of action for peace in Ukraine.
The regional branch was reformed recently in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On Saturday, June 25 the group is organising a Dorchester Demo from 11am as they call for peace in the eastern European country.
It follows from their initial meeting on May 5 that saw Lindsey German, national convenor of the Stop the War Coalition, Green Party councillor Jon Orrell and, co-chair of Dorset Stand up to Racism, Lynne Hubbard in attendance.

Ahead of the protest, which begins at the Town Pump, a spokesperson for Dorset Stop The War said: The war in Ukraine is developing into a proxy war between Russia and NATO, with the Ukrainian people suffering the consequences. Escalation is the greatest threat to world peace for decades. Rather than sending extra missiles to Ukraine, the British government should be seeking a ceasefire and peace talks.
