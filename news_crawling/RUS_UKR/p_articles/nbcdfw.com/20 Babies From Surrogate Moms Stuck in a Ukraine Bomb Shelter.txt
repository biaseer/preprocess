Theyre well cared for at the moment. Surrogacy center nurses are stranded with them, because constant shelling makes it too dangerous for them to go home.
Nurse Lyudmilla Yashchenko says theyre staying in the bomb shelter to save their lives, and the lives of the babies, some of whom are just days old. They have enough food and baby supplies for now, and can only hope and wait for the newborns to be picked up, and the war to end.

Russian troops are trying to encircle the city, with Ukrainian defenders holding them off for now, the threat comes from the air.
Now at least 20 of those babies are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter in Ukraines capital, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up.
Yashchenko said they leave briefly during the day to get some fresh air but dont dare stay out too long. She worries about her own children, too  both her sons, ages 22 and 30, are fighting to defend their country.
In peacetime, Ukraine has a thriving surrogate industry, one of the few countries where foreigners can get Ukrainian women to carry their pregnancies.
We are almost not sleeping at all, Yashchenko said. We are working round the clock.
