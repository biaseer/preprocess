The sanctions announced on Wednesday morning AEDT were another attempt to thread the needle. Hours after Russian troops moved into Ukraines two breakaway regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, the US President announced the first tranche of measures to counter what he branded as Putins flagrant violation of international law and the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The US response was constrained, in part, by Americas allies and Putin. If Biden announced sanctions that key members of the NATO alliance didnt agree with, it would have made it easier for Putin to ignore those measures or exploit them to his advantage.
Washington and Moscow were at least continuing to talk  albeit without any breakthroughs  and had even scheduled a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov this week. That has now been cancelled.
To that end, the question many in Washington are now asking is this: how do you negotiate with an aggrieved strongman who isnt acting rationally?
Hours after Putins speech  and even as Biden announced an executive order blocking new US investment and trade from flowing into two Russian separatist-held regions in Ukraine  senior Democrats in Bidens own ranks were demanding more.
On the ground in Europe, US troops will be redeployed to further protect NATOs Baltic allies  although, as Biden pointed out, this was merely a defensive move and he would not be sending US troops into Ukraine: something he knows few Americans would stomach.

Perhaps most notably, this is also the first time the US has allowed its intelligence to be used so publicly. Bit by bit, Russias playbook was laid out over weeks by White House officials to get ahead in an area that Moscow has traditionally had the upper hand: information warfare.
We have no intention of fighting Russia, he said from the White House at 6am on Wednesday AEDT. We want to send an unmistakable message that the United States together with our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory and abide by its commitments.
There are also domestic concerns. Inflation in the US has hit a 40-year high and the cost of everything from food and furniture to fuel is soaring. With the midterm elections in November, the last thing the President would want is Americans bearing the brunt of his foreign policy decisions.

The most significant response against Russia came from Germany, which announced it would halt certification of Nord Stream 2  a gas pipeline that the US has often argued would increase Europes reliance on Russian energy supplies. Biden promised two weeks ago that there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2 if Russia sent troops into Ukraine. But it was not made clear if or how the President could stop the project altogether.
Having calculated that America doesnt have sufficient national interest in fighting Russia on Ukrainian soil, he still has to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty through military aid and bolstered border security.
Among them was Delaware Senator Chris Coons, one of the Presidents closest allies, who noted that the time for taking action to impose significant costs starts now.
He also touted the mother of all sanctions: unplugging Russia from the SWIFT global electronic payment system as a last resort that could truly damage Putin.
The sanctions didnt exactly feel like the swift and severe actions the administration had talked up for weeks, and they alone will not be enough to change Putins course of action.
Republicans have long accused Biden of being weak for waiting until Russian tanks were ordered into Ukraine before sanctioning his Russian counterpart.
Washington: Having lost so much capital over Americas botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, US President Joe Bidens response to Russias aggression has always been a precarious balancing act, designed to avert war in Europe and dodge the foreign policy mistakes that dogged his first year in office.

At times, it was reminiscent of one of Donald Trumps angry rants: underpinned by attempts to re-write history peppered with complaints that his concerns had been ignored for years and defiant that NATOs expansion must be rolled back.
If the US response was too swift and too soon, there would be little left to deter Putin from unleashing the full-scale bloody incursion that the West has feared all along, which would trigger the largest conflict on the Continent since World War II.
Putins angry speech on Tuesday AEDT made it clear that he is driven by his obsession with Ukraine, his grievances with the West and his desire to maintain relevance.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez agreed, warning that authoritarian countries such as China and Iran were watching the US response to see what they could get away with.
But Biden made clear the package was simply part one of a co-ordinated plan with much more to come  if or when Russian forces move deeper into Ukraine.
Wednesdays actions fell short, but as Biden insisted: Whatever Russia does next, were ready to respond with unity, clarity and conviction. Well probably have more to say about this as we move on, and Im hoping diplomacy is still available.
In addition, sanctions have been imposed on Russian elites and their families in a bid to ensure those close to Putin dont avoid the financial pain thats expected to hit ordinary Russian citizens.
The US strategy against Russia has always been one of diplomacy and deterrence, and until recent days, there was cautious optimism that the plan might work.
Boiled down, the US will impose full blocking on two large Russian financial institutions  including the countrys military bank. The Russian government has also been cut off from Western finance, meaning it can no longer raise money from the West or trade in new debt on US or European markets.
I want to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump, he said. This is critical to me.
Biden, however, seems to be holding on to hope  at least for now. He has a tough task. Hes mobilised solidarity among the NATO allies but he must now keep that coalition intact against an adversary who is used to playing the long game.
