She said the ANC calls for progressives globally to ensure that any harm to civilians invites appropriate repercussions.
The ANC hasadded its support for a peaceful resolution to the war between Russia and Ukraine.
President Cyril Ramaphosa this week also called for mediation and a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The ANC is committed to the values of the UN for pursuance of peaceful and diplomatic resolution of conflict. The ANC therefore is quite firm in calling for commitment to dialogue and peaceful resolution of the conflict.
Even at this hour of darkness, anguish, anxiety and uncertainty, the ANC is hopeful the parties directly embroiled in the conflict will ultimately conglomerate around a negotiating table for a lasting resolution, said Zulu.
It has also faced sanctions from different nations including the US and Britain following the escalation of the conflict between the two nations.
"The ANC strongly believes that it must be the parties, who are directly involved in the conflict, that must not only commit but come to the negotiating table for resolution of such conflict.
This week, Russia has been largely condemned by other nations after its invasion of Ukraine.
History is littered with wars that have been ended or even averted through negotiations. However the dismal failure of the UN cannot be swept under the carpet, more so that, when some world leaders are openly biasedin their judgment, said Zulu.
In a statement attributed to ANC chairperson of the subcommittee on international relations Lindiwe Zulu, the party said it was deeply concerned about the rapid escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
