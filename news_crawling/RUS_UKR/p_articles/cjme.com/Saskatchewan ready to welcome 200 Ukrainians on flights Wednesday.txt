The flights set to arrive Wednesday follow a similar move in early July, which saw about 230 displaced Ukrainians arrive in Regina.
Two flights carrying about 200 displaced Ukrainian citizens are set to touch down in Regina late Wednesday night.
The provincial government has partnered with humanitarian organizations Open Arms and Solidaire to help provide the necessary supports and other services.
The government issued a poster bearing the Ukrainian flag and a message of support, and encouraged residents and businesses to print a copy and hang it in a visible location to show their support for Ukraine.
On-site staff from a settlement reception centre will be on hand to answer questions, issue health cards, help with bank accounts, and provide information on housing, employment, education, income assistance and more.
Saskatchewans approach to welcoming Ukrainian citizens is unique and speaks to Saskatchewans character, Harrison said in a statement.

Harrison has said the province is willing to accept as many displaced Ukrainians as possible. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February, more than 1,500 displaced Ukrainians have arrived in the province, according to the Saskatchewan government.
Jeremy Harrison, Saskatchewans immigration minister, said hes proud of the work being done to help ensure the newcomers feel welcomed and supported.
After arriving in Regina after a stopover in Edmonton, the passengers will step off the ramp to find temporary accommodations and a suite of support services waiting for them, according to the Government of Saskatchewan.
