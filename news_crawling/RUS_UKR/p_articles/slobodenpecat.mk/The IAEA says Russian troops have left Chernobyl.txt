Russian troops took control of Chernobyl at the start of military operations in Ukraine. The Ukrainian staff serving the facilities was left on the job.
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA says Ukrainian authorities are calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
The IAEA says Russian forces have handed over control of the plant in writing to Ukrainian personnel.
Nuclear workers say there are no more "outsiders" at Chernobyl, which has not been confirmed by the IAEA.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant complex, where the world's largest nuclear accident occurred in 1986, does not have an operating reactor to generate electricity, but the facility needs to be managed, and the dome built above the destroyed reactor still holds nuclear waste.
