The American president Joe Biden today accused Russia of being behind a rocket attack on a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, describing the incident as a "horrific crime".
"The attack on the Ukrainian train station is the latest horrific crime committed by Russia, targeting civilians trying to evacuate and reach safety," Biden wrote on Twitter.
The attack on a Ukrainian train station is yet another horrific atrocity committed by Russia, striking civilians who were trying to evacuate and reach safety.
At least 50 people have been killed in an attack on a train station as refugees from eastern Ukraine await evacuation.
