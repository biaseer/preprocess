The European Union condemns Russia for the "irresponsible violation" of the principles of nuclear safety with military activities around the Ukrainian power plant in Zaporozhye, the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said today.
He demanded that the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA get immediate access to the plant.
IAEA chief Raphael Grossi previously said that Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine is "completely out of control" and called on Russia and Ukraine to urgently allow experts to visit the complex in order to stabilize the situation and avoid a nuclear disaster.
"The EU condemns the Russian military activities near the nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye. This is a serious and irresponsible violation of the principles of nuclear safety and another example of Russian disregard for international norms," Borrell wrote on Twitter.
