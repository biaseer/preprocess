The Ministry of Defense announced that 2.439 neo-Nazis from "Azov" and Ukrainian soldiers trapped on the territory of the factory left their weapons and surrendered. The last group of 531 militants surrendered today.
These allegations can not be confirmed, and the Ukrainian side has not yet responded to the news of the Russian Defense Ministry.
Russia's defense ministry said tonight that the Azovstal plant in Mariupol had been "completely liberated".
"The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant in Mariupol, where a group of Ukrainian militants from the Nazi Azov formation has been blocked since April 21, has been completely liberated," spokesman Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman, said tonight.
Russian media have reported that Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has already informed President Vladimir Putin of the completion of the operation and the complete liberation of Azovstal and the city of Mariupol from Ukrainian forces.
Minister Shoigu said that the underground facilities in the factory were under the control of Russian troops.
