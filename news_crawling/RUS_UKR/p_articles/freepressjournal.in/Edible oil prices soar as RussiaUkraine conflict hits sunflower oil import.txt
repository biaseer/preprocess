A retailer while speaking to ANI said, "The rates of oil will not come down until the war is going on. People have started to stock up on edible oil as they fear that they will not get enough in future."
Kanhaiya Lal Gujrathi, Director, Poona Merchant's Chamber, told ANI, "The oil prices have increased by around Rs 300 to Rs 400 per 15 kg container. There is a shortage of oil in the market as the import has stopped totally." Another trader said, "There is a shortage of oil in the market and the rate, especially of the sunflower oil, has increased by around Rs 600 per 15 kg container which is going to impact the common man." The sunflower oil is imported in India majorly from Ukraine and Russia.
