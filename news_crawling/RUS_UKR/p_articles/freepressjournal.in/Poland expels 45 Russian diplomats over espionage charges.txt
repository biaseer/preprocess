"Poland has expelled 45 Russian spies pretending to be diplomats," he wrote. "We are dismantling the Russian special services network in our country."
"There are no grounds for these kinds of accusations," he said, adding that Russia reserved the right to take retaliatory measures.
"The detainee worked in the archives of Warsaw's registry office," ABW spokesman Stanislaw Zaryn said on Twitter.
"The activity of the suspect posed a threat to both the internal and external security of Poland," he added.
Earlier Wednesday, Poland's counter-espionage service ABW had announced that it had detained a Polish national suspected of espionage for Russia's secret services.
