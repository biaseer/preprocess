Later in a post, Musk shared a Telegram message from Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. "Elon Musk, a word of advice. Don't measure your strength against that of Putin. Vladimir Vladimirovich will look unsportsmanlike when he beats the hell out of you, a much weaker opponent," Kadyrov wrote.
To this, the billionaire replied by changing his name on Twitter to 'Elona Musk' and signing a post in the new name, "Thank you for the offer, but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage. If he is afraid to fight, I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed. Elona"
Earlier this month, Telsa CEO Elon Musk had challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a "one on one" combat with Ukraine being the stakes.
