The TV report from Russia did not mention Ireland directly, but showed the island being wiped out as part of a Russian nuclear strike on the UK.
Michel Martin, speaking before a Cabinet meeting yesterday Tuesday May 4 said that there should be an apology in relation to the report on Russian TV.
I think it reflects a mindset that is worrying and not in touch with reality.
Mr Martin stressed that the fundamental issue was that Russia should cease hostilities in Ukraine.
The Taoiseach has condemned as sinister a Russian TV mock-up of a nuclear attack on Ireland and the UK.
He added: The degree of bombardment and the destruction of towns and cities and human carnage that has taken place is without any justification.
He declined to say whether the Russian Ambassador, Yury Filatov, should be summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs over the incident.
It is very sinister, intimidatory type tactics by the Russian Federation, but I dont think anyone is going to be intimidated by it, Mr Martin said.
