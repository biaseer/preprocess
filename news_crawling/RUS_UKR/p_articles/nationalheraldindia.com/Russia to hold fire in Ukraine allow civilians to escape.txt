Russian armed forces said on Monday that it will hold fire and open humanitarian corridors in some Ukrainian cities from 10 a.m. Moscow time, about 12.30 p.m. IST to allow civilians to escape at the "personal request" of French President Emmanuel Macron to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, state media reported.In a statement, the Russian military said: "Given the catastrophic humanitarian situation and its sharp aggravation in the cities of Kiev, Kharkov, Sumy and Mariupol, as well as at the personal request of the President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, the Russian Armed Forces announce a ceasefire and open humanitarian corridors...," Sputnik News reported.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday afternoon, official sources said.The telephonic talks will follow Modi's scheduled conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Modi's interaction with the two leaders comes amid India's all out efforts to evacuate its nationals, mostly students, from Ukraine, facing attack from Russia.Modi had spoken to Putin earlier too when the war began.
The four mentioned cities are currently under a "significant" Russian assault operation, said the BBC.However, authorities in Ukraine are yet to confirm this development.Over the weekend, two efforts to open a route to allow civilians to evacuate from Mariupol in the country's south-east collapsed, said the BBC report.Ukrainian officials said this was because Russia continued to shell the city during the agreed ceasefire hours.
