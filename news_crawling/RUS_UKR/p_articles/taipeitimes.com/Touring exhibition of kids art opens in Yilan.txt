The artworks, most of which were created by Ukrainian children, would next travel to Mexico, Slovakia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Norway and other countries, Dancewoods said.
The 2022 I Draw Peace exhibition opened on Tuesday at Dancewood Museum and is to run through Aug. 31. It is part of the Children Draw the World exhibition that was launched in the Czech Republic in April.
The Peace Relay actively involves children all over the world who want to be happy and live in peace, no matter where they are. Peace is and will always be relevant as long as humanity exists, Lviv Childrens Art Gallery says on its Web site.
The call for childrens art was issued earlier this year by Lviv Childrens Art Gallery and the Kherson educational-aesthetic complex Art School. The drive collected more than 1,200 artworks in about two weeks, 210 of which are being displayed at the Yilan exhibition.
Dancewoods said it hopes people will visit the exhibition in Taiwan, the first Asian stop of the tour, to see the impact of the Ukraine-Russia war on children from the kids own perspective, and to appreciate the value of peace.
A touring exhibition of artworks created by children from around the world to give hope to children in war-torn Ukraine has arrived in Yilan County.
The exhibition also features artworks from Taiwan, said Dancewoods Hotels and Resorts, which is sponsoring the Taiwan leg of the tour.
They said the goal was to provide love and hope to Ukrainian children amid the Russian invasion.
