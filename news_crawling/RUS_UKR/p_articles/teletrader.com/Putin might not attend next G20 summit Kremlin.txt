The participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the next G20 summit in Bali will depend on the evolution of the current geopolitical circumstances, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov pictured said on Thursday. He added Russia will "focus on" the relations with the organizing country, Indonesia, "but depending on how the situation develops, the position on participation will be determined."
Peskov added that Moscow will respond to the latest round of Western sanctions "without fail and will do it as it sees fit." He also warned that "pumping weapons into Ukraine is not conducive to success in Russian-Ukrainian negotiations" and is more likely to have a "negative effect."
