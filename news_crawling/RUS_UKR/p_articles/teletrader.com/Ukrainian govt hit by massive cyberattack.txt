The ministry noted it is "too early to draw conclusions" on who is responsible for the attack but stressed "there is a long record of Russian assaults against Ukraine."
The Ukrainian government said on Friday it has been hit by a "massive cyberattack" that brought down the websites of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and several other government agencies.
"Our specialists are already working on restoring the work of IT systems, and the cyber police opened an investigation," a spokesperson for the ministry stated.
