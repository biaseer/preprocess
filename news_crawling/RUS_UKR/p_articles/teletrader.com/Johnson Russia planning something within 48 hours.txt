British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that there are "no signs so far" that Russia will deescalate the crisis at the Ukrainian border, describing the current situation as "extremely concerning." He claimed Russia is "at least planning for something that could take place as early as the next 48 hours" and repeated the British government must be ready to impose "very, very severe" sanctions on Moscow in case of invasion.
"We are on the edge of a precipice but there is still time for President Putin to step back," Johnson stated, warning that an invasion of Ukraine would be a "disastrous mistake." He also called on the Western allies to unite in their stance on the crisis, adding cannot "trade away" Ukraine's future NATO membership.
