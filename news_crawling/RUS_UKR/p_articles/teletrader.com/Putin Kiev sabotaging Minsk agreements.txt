Russian President Vladimir Putin told United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday that Ukraine is carrying out "chronic sabotage" of the Minsk agreements, the aim of which is to end hostilities in eastern Ukraine.
According to the Kremlin's readout of the phone conversation between the two leaders, Putin also pointed to "NATO's unwillingness to adequately respond to well-founded Russian concerns... while hiding behind references to the so-called 'open door' policy of the alliance, which contradicts the fundamental principle of the indivisibility of security."
The "indivisibility of security" principle originates from agreements signed in 1999 in Istanbul and in Astana in 2010, between, among others, Russia and the United States, which states that signatories will not "strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other" signatories.
