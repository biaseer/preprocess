German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated on Friday Berlin will fight for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, repeating her criticism of Moscow for the takeover of the area.
Further, she called for an investigation into the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexey Navalny and condemned Kremlin for banning some German and United States organizations from working in the country.
"We wonder how it's possible to continue cooperation between our societies when these organizations are not allowed to work," she added.
