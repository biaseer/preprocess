Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Vadym Prystaiko urged allies on Friday to "unblock the Black Sea," which is currently under Russian control. He called for NATO members to "reinforce the effort" by sending their ships to the sea and in particular to the Ukrainian port of Odesa.
Prystaiko argued that Ukrainian grain exports must be allowed passage through the Black Sea to avoid a food crisis. "We are responsible for a significant chunk of food security around the globe. Many nations in Africa are fed because of Ukrainian grain. And this grain is stuck in our silos, it cant be exported, it cant be sent anywhere," he told Sky News.
