On Monday last week, Albanese said that Canberra will provide an additional $74 million military assistance package to Kiev in its efforts to fend off the Russian assaults.
Australia will restart its support pays for workers having to go into quarantine due to a new wave of COVID-19 omicron-led wave in the country, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Saturday.
"I want to make sure that people aren't left behind, that vulnerable people are looked after ... No one should be faced with the unenviable choice of not being able to isolate properly without losing an income and without being put in a situation that is very difficult," Albanese told reporters.
