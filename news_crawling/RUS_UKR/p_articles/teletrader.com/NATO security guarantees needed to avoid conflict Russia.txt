Speaking to Ria Novosti, Ryabkov said that NATO should provide legally binding guarantees that the alliance won't expand to the east or place its weapons near the Russian border. "Assurances from NATO members, and they are often heard too, that NATO has no intentions to deploy such nuclear weapons do not convince us of anything," Ryabkov stated.
Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned on Monday that the lack of NATO's security guarantees would likely lead to confrontation.
