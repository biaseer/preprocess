Earlier, it was revealed that the first ship carrying grain from Ukrainian ports sailed today, while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed its departure.
Erdogan noted that "the work that started under our leadership is a diplomatic success and a historic turning point." The head of Turkey assured that Ankara will be there every step of the way when Moscow and Kiev "start moving towards peace."
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated on Monday, during a televised appearance after the Cabinet meeting, that Turkey's efforts to bring Ukraine and Moscow to the negotiating table made it possible for the grain deal to be reached.
