Austrian Foreign Ministry Alexander Schallenberg announced on Saturday that Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's Permanent Representative to International Organizations in Vienna and Chief Negotiator, has been summoned to the country's foreign ministry over remarks on Ukraine on Sunday.
Previously, Ulyanov wrote in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's tweet about the newest military aid from Washington, "No mercy to the Ukrainian population!" Later, he clarified that his comments were solely "critical observations" of the Ukrainian government's policy and not at all a call for ruthless action.
"We stand for freedom of expression. But we are also free to take a firm stand against such inflammatory statements," said the foreign minister. "We are outraged by the inhuman statements made by the Russian Permanent Representative and by his attempts to put into perspective what cannot be put into perspective," he added.
