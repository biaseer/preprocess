During the last days, Russia's primary goal has likely been the reorientation of troops to reinforce southern Ukraine, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense said in its latest intelligence report published Sunday.
Besides, the heaviest fighting has centered on the village of Pisky, near the site of the Donetsk airport, probably because the settlement remains contested. "The Russian assault likely aims to secure the M04 highway, the main approach to Donetsk from the west," added the report.
"However, in the Donbas, Russian-backed forces  largely militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic  have continued to attempt assaults to the north of Donetsk city," said the communique.
