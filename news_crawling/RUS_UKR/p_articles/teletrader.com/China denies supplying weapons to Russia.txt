China has not provided Russia with military support in its conflict with Ukraine, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said on Sunday. He insisted Beijing is not interested in the conflict and supports peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.
Wei also criticized the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West. "Providing weapons, imposing maximum pressure does not help solve the problem. The crisis is still escalating. The war is continuing, so these measures wont work. Chinas position is consistent. We believe it is necessary to facilitate peace talks to restore peace."
