The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned ambassadors from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Tass reported on Tuesday. The move reportedly follows the decision of the three Baltic states to expel a total of ten Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine.
A source familiar with the decision said the ambassadors were summoned "in connection with the Russian decision to expel their diplomats based on the principle of reciprocity." Last week, Poland ordered 45 Russian diplomats to leave the country, while Moscow vowed to reciprocate.
