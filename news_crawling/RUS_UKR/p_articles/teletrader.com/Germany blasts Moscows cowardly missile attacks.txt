Baerbock slammed the "cowardly" move, claiming it goes to show "that the Russian leadership's signature counts for little at the moment."
Her comments are only the latest on the list of criticisms directed at Moscow after the Kremlin allegedly orchestrated an offensive on the Ukrainian port, just one day after inking agreements promising to allow exports of grains to resume.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Saturday condemned Moscow's alleged attack on the Ukrainian port of Odessa.
