Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated on Saturday that reports about the evacuation of Russian diplomats from the embassy in Ukraine are rumors.
Earlier in the morning, Ria Novosti reported that Russia began withdrawing its diplomatic staff from Ukraine, quoting sources familiar with the matter.
"As you may recall, rumors about the alleged evacuation of Russian diplomats appeared in several Western publications... a month ago during the Orthodox Christmas vacations, when several children of Russian diplomats in Ukraine went to visit their grandparents," said Zakharova. "In this situation, fearing possible provocations by the Kiev regime or third countries, we actually decided to optimize the personnel of the Russian foreign missions in Ukraine."
