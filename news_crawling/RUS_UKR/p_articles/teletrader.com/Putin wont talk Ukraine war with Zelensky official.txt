"The thing is that we cannot discuss the issue of Ukraine's domestic conflict. Russia is not a party to this conflict. Nothing has changed here, we repeatedly stated this at various levels," the official asserted.
Since the beginning of the war in 2014, Moscow has denied direct involvement in Ukraine despite numerous proofs of Russian military participation in the conflict. On several occasions, Kiev has captured Russian Armed Forces members that were illegally in Ukraine. In addition, uniquely Russian military vehicles and weapons were found to be used in the conflict.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will not talk about the Ukraine conflict with the country's President Vladimir Zelensky, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov pictured said on Monday.
