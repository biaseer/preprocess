The discoveries followed the Russian retreat from the area around the capital, territory that has seen heavy fighting since troops invaded Ukraine from three directions on Feb. 24.

As images of the bodies  of people whom residents said were killed indiscriminately  began to emerge from Bucha, a slew of European leaders condemned the atrocities and called for tougher sanctions against Moscow.
