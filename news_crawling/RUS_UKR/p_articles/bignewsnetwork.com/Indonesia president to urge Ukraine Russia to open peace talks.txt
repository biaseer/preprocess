JAKARTA, Indonesia: Indonesian President Joko Widodo has said that he will urge his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to open peace talks while visiting the two countries on a peace-building mission, adding that he will also ask Russian President Vladimir Putin to order an immediate ceasefire.Popularly known as Jokowi, he said, before leaving for Germany to attend the G7 summit this week, "War has to be stopped and global food supply chains need to be reactivated."Widodo will also encourage the G7 countries to seek peace in Ukraine following Russia's invasion, and find an immediate solution to global food and energy crises, he added.Food and fertilizer products from Russia and Ukraine need to be "reintegrated into the global market, despite the war," noted Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi.In a statement, Marsudi added, "It is necessary to secure a grain corridor from Ukraine and open food and fertilizer exports from Russia. All countries must refrain from actions that further exacerbate this food crisis."While Indonesia has condemned the war and expressed sympathy for Ukraine, in April Widodo said he had declined a request for arms from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
