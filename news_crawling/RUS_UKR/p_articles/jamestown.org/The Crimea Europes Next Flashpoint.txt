Russia has an even more impossible time recognizing Ukraines sovereignty over the Crimea and the port of Sevastopol  as seen by public opinion in Russia, statements by politicians, including members of the ruling United Russia party, experts and journalists. The signing of an inter-state treaty in 1997 recognizing the Russian-Ukrainian border also paved the way for a compromise twenty year Russian lease of the Sevastopol navy base for the Black Sea Fleet BSF. Four factors have unraveled this compromise, including Russias desire to re-establish itself internationally as a Great Power, the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia. In The Crimea: Europes Next Flashpoint? Kuzio addresses these factors and more in an in-depth analysis of Russian-Ukraine relations and the future of the Crimea and the port of Sevastopol.
