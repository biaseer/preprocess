Ukraine will work to officially "qualify" the siege as genocide on the international stage, she pledged.
Around 200,000 people are currently trapped in Mariupol, encircled and under fire from relentless shelling since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24.
"Theatres of war have some rules, some principles. What we see in Mariupol, are no rules at all," she added.
"It's impossible to give them food, water, electricity and the Russian Federation exactly knows what they are doing here," she added.
"What now I see in Mariupol it's not about war, it's about genocide," Venediktova told AFP.
Mariupol -- home to 450,00 before the war began -- has witnessed some of the most vicious violence nationwide.
"Mariupol residents have described a freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings," a Human Rights Watch official said Monday.
Seizing the port would also deprive Ukraine of a resupply route with the outside world on its southern Black Sea coast.
Mariupol is a key asset for Russia which would complete a "land bridge" between the Crimean peninsula annexed in 2014 and the Donbas region occupied by pro-Russia forces.
Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova on Tuesday said evidence shows Russia is committing 'genocide' through its siege on the strategic port city of Mariupol.
Incoming humanitarian aid and outgoing evacuation convoys have struggled to penetrate the boundaries of the brutal siege.
Artillery has hammered a maternity hospital, flattened residential areas, and struck a theatre despite signs declaring children were sheltering inside.
