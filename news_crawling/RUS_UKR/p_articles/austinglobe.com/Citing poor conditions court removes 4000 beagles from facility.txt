CUMBERLAND, Virginia: As part of a plan approved by a federal judge last week, the Humane Society of the United States will transfer 4,000 beagles from a research facility in Cumberland, Virginia, to its branches around the U.S. where they can be adopted.A series of inspections over nine months discovered more than 70 animal welfare violations at the Envigo breeding facility, and a motion filed in June said federal agents had already seized 446 beagles. Over the next 60 days, the Humane Society will transport the remaining beagles from the facility at its own expense.In a statement after the ruling, Inotiv, Inc., Envigo's parent company, said it "will implement an orderly closure plan" of its Cumberland facility. Also, Virginia senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine stated, "After months of advocacy, we are heartened to know that nearly 4,000 Envigo dogs will be spared a lifetime of suffering and will instead head to loving homes. We are also pleased to know that Inotiv, Envigo's parent company, will shutter its Cumberland facility and that no more dogs will be subject to the appalling conditions and inexcusable distress endured by so many dogs and puppies at the facility. We will continue working in the Senate to prevent the mistreatment of innocent animals across Virginia and the nation."In an interview with CNN, Sue Bell, the executive director and founder of Homeward Trails Animal Rescue, said her group took 36 dogs from the 446 beagles that were removed earlier this year, adding that the dogs were adopted within three weeks."We hope to get about 200 to 250 beagles off the property on 19th July," Bell said, as reported by CNN.The group will prioritize removing pregnant dogs, juvenile dogs and mother dogs with unweaned puppies, Bell added, stating, "We prefer the pregnant dogs do not give birth at that facility. We hope to get them home first." Animal rights organization PETA lauded last week's ruling.
