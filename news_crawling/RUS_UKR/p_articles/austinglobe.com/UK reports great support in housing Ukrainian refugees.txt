LONDON, England: The UK government has launched its 'Homes for Ukraine' site for those British wanting to host Ukrainian refugees, with 100,000 signing up during the first day.Michael Gove, Housing and Communities Secretary, said the UK has a history of "supporting the most vulnerable during their darkest hours," adding that there would be no limit to how many Ukrainians can enter the country under the scheme.Each household housing a refugee will be offered a tax-free fund of 350 pounds per month, and while they will not be expected to provide food and living expenses, they can choose to offer these.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was "fantastic" that more than 100,000 people and organizations had expressed interest in supporting Ukrainians, tweeting, "Thank you to everyone across the country who has stepped up to offer their help so far."Those wishing to offer a rent-free space in their home or a separate residence for at least six months can register their interest online.Those interested will be able to individually sponsor a Ukrainian national's visa, with initial applications relying on the applicant knowing a named individual from Ukraine they want to help.But Ukrainian refugees with no family or other links to the UK can still be hosted as part of the scheme, Gove said.The scheme will be expanded with the support of charities, community groups and churches who can help with matching refugees to hosts.The government has faced criticism, including from its own MPs, over its response to the refugee crisis, triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Under the scheme, refugees will have access to the NHS and other public services, and their children will be able to attend local schools.Local authorities will also receive 10,500 pounds in extra funding per refugee for support services, with more being available for children of school age.The government said both hosts and refugees taking part in Homes for Ukraine will be vetted, and local councils will ensure the accommodation offered is suitable for housing Ukrainians.Lisa Nandy, shadow housing and communities secretary, said Labour was concerned about "the lack of urgency," adding that the visa application process could be simplified."We could keep essential checks but drop the excessive bureaucracy," she said, as reported by the BBC.Mandi Arnold, 35, who lives in Shropshire with her partner and three children, has applied to join the scheme."I would love to welcome someone in my home to give them that security and love," she said, as quoted by the BBC.Refugees at Home, which finds host families for refugees and asylum seekers, said it wanted to see "as many refugees housed as soon as possible."But Lauren Scott, executive director of Refugees at Home, stressed that home visits should take place before a placement is made and called for follow-up support to be offered.Iryna Terlecky, board member of the Associations of Ukrainians in Great Britain and chair of the Association of Ukrainian Women, praised the British public's response to the scheme, but she told the Today program that 10,500 pounds per refugee "may well not be enough."The UK Home Office has defended requiring security checks on Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia's invasion, stressing that it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need.
