NEW DELHI, India: The Reserve Bank of India has reported that India's economy would become the world's fastest-growing economy, and has remained resilient in the face of global challenges and ongoing inflation.In a bulletin, the Reserve Bank said due to the recent revival of the southwest monsoon and renewed planting, rural demand will soon catch up with urban spending and ensure a recovery."Knock-on effects of geopolitical spillovers are visible in several sectors, tapering the pace of recovery. In spite of this overwhelming shock, there are sparks in the wind that ignite the innate strength of the economy and set it on course to becoming the fastest growing economy in the world, though besieged it might be by fears of recession," the Reserve Bank said in a report.If the recent commodity price moderation continues, alongside the easing of supply chain pressures, the surge in inflation will be largely over, it added.However, data released last week showed India's annual consumer inflation remained above the 7 percent mark and beyond the central bank's tolerance band for the sixth consecutive month."There is some evidence now that supply-chain pressures are peaking globally and in India, so that a major source of upward inflation pressures may be ebbing," the bank stated.The Reserve Bank said India's current account deficit could rise to 2.3 percent of GDP in 202223 if oil prices reach an average of $105 per barrel, and could continue to widen to 2.8 percent if oil averages $120 per barrel, but still remains "within the sustainable limit of 3 percent.""External debt remains modest as a proportion to GDP, and has actually declined between March 2021 and March 2022," the Reserve Bank added.
