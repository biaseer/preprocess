The system with an unmanned aerial vehicle target drones is designed to simulate low-speed drones and helicopters when testing prototype and modernized weapons. It includes a helicopter-type unmanned aerial vehicle with a take-off weight of over 315 kg, a ground control station, ground support facilities for the complex, and other equipment.
The footage showed that the drone was completely disintegrated but it is possible to identify the rotor and tail boom as well as the label that matches the Russian drone target developed by the JSC CSTS Dinamika, part of Technodinamika Group.
