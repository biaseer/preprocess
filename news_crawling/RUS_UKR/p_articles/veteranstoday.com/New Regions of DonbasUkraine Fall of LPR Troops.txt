SVPressa: During the night, as part of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, hostilities continued on the outskirts of Kharkov and Nikolaev.
Information comes that Russian troops conducted reconnaissance in battle in the area of the city of Chuguev, located not far from Kharkov to the southeast.A part of the Kharkov garrison of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the national battalions is concentrated there on the Chuguev-Zmiev line.Such actions of the Russian troops could be aimed at finding out what the military potential of the Ukrainian group in this direction is and whether it is able to move towards the Donbass for a possible strike on the right flank of the Russian army.
