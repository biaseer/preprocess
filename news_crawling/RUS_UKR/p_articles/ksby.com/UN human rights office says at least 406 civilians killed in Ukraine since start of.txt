GENEVA  The U.N. human rights office says it has been able to confirm the deaths of 406 civilians in Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion.
The U.N. says it believes the real figures are considerably higher, especially in government-controlled territory and especially in recent days.
Fighting has delayed its receipt of information, and many reports still need to be corroborated.
The latest figures come as Russia continues to attack Ukraine, despite promising to brief ceasefires that would allow civilians to exit the country. Many of those safe corridors led into Russia and its neighboring ally, Belarus, prompting criticism from Ukrainian officials.
