Russias energy giant Gazprom cut gas supplies after Finland refused to pay for the gas in rubles as demanded by Russian President Vladimir Putin after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.
The Finnish state-controlled oil company Neste has also decided to replace imports of Russian crude oil with crude from elsewhere.
The highly symbolic move that came early Saturday marks a likely end to nearly 50 years of natural gas import from Moscow to Helsinki.
