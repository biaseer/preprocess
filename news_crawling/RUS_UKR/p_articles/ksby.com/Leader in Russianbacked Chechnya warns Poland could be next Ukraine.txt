Ramzan Kadyrov, who is famous for his bluster, said in the video he posted to his official Telegram page that Ukraine was a done deal and that if an order is given after Ukraine, well show you Poland what youre made of in six seconds.
The Kremlin-backed leader of Russias southern province of Chechnya has posted a video in which he warns that Poland could be next after Ukraine.
Kadyrov has repeatedly used social media to boast about Chechen fighters alleged performance against Ukrainian troops and to make other unconfirmed statements about the war in Ukraine.
Poland, which borders Ukraine, has provided its neighbor with weapons and other aid since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. It has also welcomed in millions of Ukrainian refugees.
Kadyrov later urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to finally come to his senses and accept the conditions offered by our president Vladimir Putin.
