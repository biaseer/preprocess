The organization Mac has chosen to give the money hes raised to is the charity Save The Children, which provides emergency aid to children in conflict zones. When asked what he might say to other kids who want to do something to help Ukrainians, Mac says, "I would say to them, if your heart pulls you, then either set up a lemonade stand like I do, or just donate $20 or $100 to a place that would help Ukrainian children, or Ukrainians in general, because every single cent counts."
A ten-year-old Texas boy has raised thousands for children in Ukraine with his lemonade stand.Mac Connatserwas watching the news of the Russian invasion of Ukraine with his father and decided he wanted to do something to help the children of Ukraine.
