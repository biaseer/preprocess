Some Ukrainian government websites are offline as a result of a cyberattack.That's according to the head of Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation.The attack also impacted several banks, but the source is not yet confirmed despite the timing as Russian troops gather around Ukraine's borders.Russia denied responsibility for a separate cyberattack last week that affected four government websites.
Russia is promising a "strong response" to sanctions put on it by the U.S. and others.Its Foreign Ministry described moves by the U.S. as "ineffective and counterproductive" to America's interests.It added that sanctions won't affect its determination to stick up for what's best for Russia.Nations around the world have begun imposing sanctions on Russia after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.Two separatist regions have been declared by Russia as independent.
