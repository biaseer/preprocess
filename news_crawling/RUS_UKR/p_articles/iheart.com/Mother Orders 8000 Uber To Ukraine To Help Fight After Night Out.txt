Now we all know that drinking can have good and bad consequences and in this case, well someone almost lost $8,000. Leoni was out having drinks for a friend's birthday when they started to talk about the Russia and Ukraine war currently going on. After a few drinks, Leoni and her friends decided that they had to help Ukraine and while it is easy to find places to donate money to she decided that it was time to go to Ukraine at that very moment to go to the country to join the fight.
So.... she called an Uber to com toe take her, when she woke up she was not in Ukraine but she did wake up to a message from her bank ringing her about her card being used fraudulently, Uber tried to take the money out of her account not once but NINE times. Luckly for her she didn't wake up in Ukraine.
Donkey Of The Day For Friday March 18th goes to 34 year old Leoni Fildes who ordered an $8,000 uber to help Ukraine fight Russia after a long night out.
