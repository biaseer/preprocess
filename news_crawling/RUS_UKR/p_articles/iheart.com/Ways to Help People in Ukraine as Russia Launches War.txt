United Help Ukraine provided humanitarian relief and medical aid. The non-profit organization is currently raising money to help support those living near the front lines and those who have been injured or forced to leave their homes. Visit unitedhelpukraine.org
The United Nations Children's Fund says they are currently "working across eastern Ukraine to scale up life-saving programs for children and repair schools." Visit unicefusa.org
Donations to the ICRC, which is working alongside the Ukrainian Red Cross, will help deliver "urgent assistance" like food, water, fuel, medical supplies, and more. Visit icrc.org
Project Dynamo is a non-profit helping bring Americans home from Ukraine. Project Dynamo was cofounded by combat veteran Bryan Stern. He formed Dynamo in the middle of the U.S. evacuation of Afghanistan in August. In addition to sending buses to the border, Stern was able to get some people onto commercial flights before the Russian attack. If an American asks me for help, Stern said, I say, Yes.
The world was brought to a standstill as news broke that Russia had invaded Ukraine on Thursday February 24. From the Red Cross to United Help Ukraine, organizations are stepping up to assist people suffering from the impact of Russia's invasion.
