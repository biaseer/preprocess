Watch Snider speak more about the efforts to stop the war in Ukraine via the player above.
Snider explained in a statement that World United Live contacted him about a month ago, after Russia's war with Ukraine began. Snider was quick to condemn Russian leader Vladmir Putin for the war and had repeatedly urged others to do the same.
Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider is stepping up his support of the Ukrainian people, contributing a reworked version of one of his solo songs to World United Live.
"We are organizing the world's largest mass protest in record time," reads a statement from World United Live. "A worldwide concert event to raise money and provide support for the brave people of Ukraine. In addition, a campaign to use the voices of artists to speak on our behalf to the people of Russia. There is no later, time is of the essence. If we do not stand up now and if Ukraine falls it is too late and evil entrenches itself. We must act together today to send this message. The alternative is World War and mass suffering."
World United Live is working to circumvent Russia's state propaganda network inform the Russian people of what is truly happening in Ukraine with the help of celebrities like Snider.
On Thursday, Snider released a new version of his song "Stand" with the new title "Stand With Ukraine." You can watch the full music video here and learn how to help World United Live here.
Snider added that Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent message to the Russian people is a perfect example of the World United Live efforts. Other World United Live contributors include Disturbed frontman David Draiman and Fozzy frontman Chris Jericho.
