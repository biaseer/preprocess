A beauty queen and former Miss Grand Ukraine, Anastasiia Lenna, is going viral after she reportedly joined the Ukrainian military to fight against the Russian invasion.
She received backlash over the viral images but said the images of herself holding weapons were not intended to promote violence, and that they were taken while she was playing airsoft.
All pictures in my profile are to inspire people  I dont do any propaganda except showing our women of Ukraine  strong, confident and powerful. I appreciate all attention and support to my country, all people in Ukraine we fight every day against Russian aggression.
