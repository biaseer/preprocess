Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, South Florida, physicianTatyana Borisiakwas looking for ways to help her hometown in Western Ukraine. When she realized the local hospital was still using the same ambulance they had when she volunteered there as a teenager, she raised $37-thousand and bought them a new one. The ambulance is already helping to bring wounded fighters from the front line and now Borisiak is working on getting medical supplies to them in the coming weeks.
