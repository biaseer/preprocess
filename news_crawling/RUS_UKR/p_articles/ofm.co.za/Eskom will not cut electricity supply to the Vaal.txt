This comes after a voice note purporting to be from Eskom stating that the power utility is planning to disconnect electricity supply to its customers in the Vaal - which has caused concerns.
The Emfuleni Local Municipality has emphasised that Eskom will not disconnect electricity supply to the Vaal Triangle.
The municipality says it has engaged with Eskom in the Sedibeng region regarding the voice note, adding the voice note is fake news.
