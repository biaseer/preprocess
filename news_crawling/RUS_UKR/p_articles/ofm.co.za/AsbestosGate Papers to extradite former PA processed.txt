Paperwork - to ensure that the former personal assistant of suspended ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, is extradited back into the country to stand trial for her alleged role in the failed R255 million asbestos project - is underway.
This is according to the National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson, Mthunzi Mhaga, who spoke to the media outside the Free State High Court on Monday, following the adjournment of the civil litigation in the asbestos project case. Magashule's former PA, Moroadi Cholota, was dropped as a witness after tension between the parties boiled over.OFM News earlier reported the state in 2021 accused Cholota, who now lives in America, of failing to cooperate, and she was then added as a suspect in the matter. State prosecutor in the criminal case, Adv. Johan de Nysschen, told Judge President Cagney Musi that Cholota was not cooperating with state detectives.ALSO READ: BreakingNews: Warrant of arrest out for Magashule's former PA in USOFM News previously reported that, as outlined in Pieter Louis Myburghs book Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule's Web of Capture, Cholota made several requests for money transactions to Mpambani.In a twist of events, last year audio of Cholota and two Hawks investigators surfaced and caused a stir, with Cholota claiming that she was being bullied by the investigators.Cholota wanted what she terms as "unconstitutional charges" against her - for her alleged role in the failed R255 million asbestos project - to be dropped.ALSO READ: AsbestosGate: Former Ace PA wants charges droppedMoroadi Cholota has penned a nine-page letter with the assistance of her legal representative where she is detailing her ordeal at the hands of the Hawks and the American FBI.
