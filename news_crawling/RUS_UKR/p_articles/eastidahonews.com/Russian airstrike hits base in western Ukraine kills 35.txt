After talks aimed at reaching a cease-fire again failed Saturday, the U.S. announced plans to provide another $200 million to Ukraine for weapons. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned other nations that sending equipment to bolster Ukraines military was an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets.
The city of Lviv itself so far has been spared the scale of destruction unfolding to its east and south. Its population of 721,000 has swelled during the war with residents escaping other bombarded population centers and as a waystation for the nearly 2.6 million refugees who fled the country.

Zelenskyy has accused Russia of trying to break his country apart, as well as starting a new stage of terror with the alleged detention of a mayor from a city west of Mariupol. He also alleged Saturday that Russians were using blackmail and bribery in an attempt to force local officials in the southern Kherson region to form a pseudo-republic like those in the two eastern regions where pro-Russian separatists began fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014.
The base has also hosted international NATO drills and a senior NATO official, Admiral Rob Bauer, previously hailed it as embodying the spirit of military cooperation between Ukraine and international forces. As such, the site symbolizes a longstanding Russian complaint: that the 30-member Western military alliance has expanded in Eastern Europe too close to Russian territory.
In some of his strongest denunciations yet of the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis on Sunday decried the barbarianism of the killing of children and other civilians and pleaded for the attacks to end before cities are reduced to cemeteries.

But continued fighting on multiple fronts heaped further misery on the country Sunday and provoked renewed international outrage.

Zelenskyy again deplored NATOs refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said Ukraine has sought ways to procure air defense assets, though he didnt elaborate. NATO has said that imposing a no-fly zone could lead to a wider war with Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address that a convoy carrying 100 tons of humanitarian aid was on its way to Mariupol, and all necessary diplomatic efforts have been taken to make sure it reaches those in need.

NATO said Sunday that it currently does not have any personnel in Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the West would respond if Russias armaments travel outside Ukraine and hit any NATO members, even accidentally.
Russian fighters also fired at the airport in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, which is less than 150 kilometers 94 miles north of Romania and 250 kilometers 155 miles from Hungary, countries that also are NATO allies. The airport, which includes a military airfield as well as a runway for civilian flights, also was targeted Friday.
