Despite Russia's vastly larger armed forces, Ukraine's airspace remains contested, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's country currently mounting a viable defense, the senior defense official said.
Logistics problems are stalling a massive Russian convoy that's pushing its way toward Kyiv, according to a senior U.S. defense official. The convoy, which has been measured as stretching for 40 miles, is apparently being hampered by fuel and food shortages.
The news comes as Russia continues to concentrate attacks on the large Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv.
The official told reporters it's possible that the Russians are now regrouping and their leaders are rethinking their invasion strategy. Since the war began last week, Ukraine's military  and its regular citizens  have repeatedly shown a willingness to engage with the Russian force.
As in the first days of the war, Russia's military appears to be having more success in southern Ukraine, the official said.
"The U.S. says about 80 of the estimated 190,000 Russian troops that rimmed Ukraine are now in the country," NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman reports. "About 400 missiles have been fired by the Russians since the invasion began last week."
As night fell on Ukraine on Tuesday, Russia's large convoy was still about 18 miles north of Kyiv  representing little or no change from Monday, the official said. The official added that some elements within the military column are "literally out of gas" and having difficulty feeding their troops.
