Once again, the 200 hour moving average green line was ultimately broken to the upside in the London morning session currently at 1.13571, but momentum could not be sustained.

Taking a broader look at the daily chart below, the high for February on Feb 10 moved above a ceiling at 1.1483 the high reached 1.1494 but quickly reversed back below that ceiling.  The price has been below the lower 100 day MA since February 11. The highs from last week, and again yesterday, stalled ahead of that MA level.  Stay below keeps the sellers more in control.

Yesterday, the price of EURUSD initially moved higher and extended above that 200 hour moving average in the process. However, momentum could not be sustained, and the price rotated back to the downside as RussianUkraine news started to dominate and the EUR moved lower.
Today the low in the Asian session look to approach last week's low at 1.12791, but could only get to 1.1287 eight pips short of the low before consolidating near the 50 retracement at 1.13075, and ultimately breaking back to the upside.
Although broken twice and failed twice, the 200 hour moving average remains an important barometer for the buyers and sellers. Another move above and the bias will shift back to the upside as long as the price can stay above that moving average level.
