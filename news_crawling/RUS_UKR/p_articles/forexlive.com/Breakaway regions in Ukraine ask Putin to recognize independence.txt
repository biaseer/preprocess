If Putin does that, does it really change the state of play? Russia's ruble and equity markets are falling today so maybe it does but I don't think Europe wants to harshly sanction Russia over something that's already de-facto happening.
Putin is slated to speak at the Duma either today or tomorrow and the legislative body has passed a motion to recognize the breakaway regions. There's tremendous pressure on Putin at home to do that, as they're Russian speakers.
I don't think these requests are anything new. They want Russia to recognize their independence and sign agreements on friendship and defense cooperation.
I think there's a fine line that Russia can walk here and not upend everything but it's truly threading the needle.
