In case you missed it, Russia had over the weekend demanded that troops in Mariupol lay down their weapons and surrender in return for letting tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the heavily besieged city leave safely.
For some context, Mariupol is a heavily contested battleground in the war considering that if Russians do capture it, it would secure a land corridor to Crimea - which was annexed by Moscow in 2014.
