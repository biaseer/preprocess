Ukraine president Zelensky is now out saying that Russia has resumed missile strikes at 4am local time, aimed at both military and civilian targets. He does add that Russian troops were stopped from advancing in most directions though. This is going to be quite the drawn out battle it seems.
With constant missile attacks and the threat of air attacks, it is quite a harrowing situation for those in Kyiv right now.
