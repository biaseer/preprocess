In the commodities space, gold is the big gainer as it jumped to fresh eight-month highs - hitting above $1,890 - amid the back and forth headlines. Oil prices are more subdued and keeping lower by nearly 2 below $92 as an Iran nuclear deal draws closer.
Things kicked off in late Asia Pacific trading where Russia accused Ukraine of attacks on four LPR localities - which was denied later on by Ukraine itself. Thereafter, Ukraine threw back its own accusation that Russia fired on a village in Luhansk, shelling a kindergarten. Russia didn't deny that though but kept up its rhetoric from yesterday that its troops are retreating.
Another day, another episode of he said, she said as Russia and Ukraine throw accusations of aggression at each other.
The initial response was a quick shove lower in risk trades, with the yen and dollar bid before the greenback giving most - if not all - of that back in European morning trade. The aussie and kiwi saw a significant bounce as well as such.
It remains to be seen how things will play out as tensions remain high and even though Russia is trying to portray a less aggressive stance, it's tough to say what exactly will happen at the end of the day.
AUDUSD moved up from 0.7150 to 0.7210 and is holding near the highs for the day now. NZDUSD saw a similar move from 0.6660 to 0.6715. Meanwhile, EURUSD also pared its earlier drop from 1.1325 to 1.1370 though USDJPY kept lower and is down 0.4 to near 115.00 at the moment.
The yen move is holding as bonds are still more bid with 10-year Treasury yields down over 4 bps to 2.00. Elsewhere, equities remain more subdued but at least off earlier lows with SP 500 futures down 0.3 and European indices more mixed.
