"The news involving Russia and Ukraine may have helped with the surge higher but it is tough to go against the charts at this stage. The only thing I would be mindful about is that this week's gains would be the seventh consecutive one for oil, and that is quite a stretch.
WTI crude is trading to its highest since 2014 and there isn't any clear resistance all the way through to $100 perhaps next. However, there is still plenty of food for thought despite the technical appeal. I outlined that earlier:
That is not to mention the size of the move. The run of gains here came from when price was below $70. That marks a near 30 jump in prices since the beginning of the rally.
No one can say for sure how that pans out but I highly doubt we'll see any major military escalation, not in this day and age surely.
From a technical perspective, it is hard to go against the risebreak in oil prices at the moment.
I have been and am still a major oil bull but we are getting to the point where I reckon prices may see more of a ceiling soon enough. $100 is a big level to watch in that regard. Just about every big house is calling for that, so it is quite the psychological barrier.
I fear that once geopolitical tensions involving Russia and Ukraine abate, that might be a great 'excuse' for traders to scale out on longs. That might be where oil hits a bit of an air pocket and finally meets a correction after the recent rally.
That said, tensions may still persist for longer and alongside more favourable technicals, this oil rally may still have more legs to go running further."
