Well, not that it means anything. But this is still all part of the show as both sides are just waiting for some kind of formal development or concession. The latter is unlikely to materialise so that is where we are at, pretty much a stalemate of sorts.
To be fair, the wording in the headline is meant to read that Putin is regretting that Ukraine has been slow in negotiations. So, yeah your typical finger-pointing. In any case, carry on as you will.
