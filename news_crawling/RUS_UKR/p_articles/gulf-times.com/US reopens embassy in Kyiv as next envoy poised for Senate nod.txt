We stand proudly with, and continue to support, the government and people of Ukraine as they defend their country from the Kremlins brutal war of aggression.
The Ukrainian people, with our security assistance, have defended their homeland in the face of Russias unconscionable invasion, and, as a result, the Stars and Stripes are flying over the embassy once again, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
As we take this momentous step, we have put forward additional measures to increase the safety of our colleagues who are returning to Kyiv and have enhanced our security measures and protocols, said Blinken.
The United States reopened its embassy in Kyiv yesterday after closing it for three months due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the State Department said.
The State Department closed the embassy in Kyiv on February 14, 10 days before Russian troops poured over the border in a long-anticipated effort to oust the Ukraine government and install one more in line with Moscow.
US diplomats continued to offer services from the far-west city of Lviv, at times staying overnight in neighbouring Poland due to security concerns.
Meanwhile, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday unanimously approved US President Joe Bidens nominee to be the next ambassador to Ukraine, veteran diplomat Bridget Brink, and planned to push for her quick confirmation by the full Senate. Brink is expected to easily win confirmation to a crucial position that has been vacant for three years.
