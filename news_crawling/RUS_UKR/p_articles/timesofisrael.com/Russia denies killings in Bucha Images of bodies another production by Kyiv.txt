MOSCOW  Russias defense ministry says today its forces did not kill civilians in Bucha, a town outside Ukraines capital Kyiv recently retaken by Ukrainian forces from Moscows troops.
Thats why we started the Times of Israel ten years ago - to provide discerning readers like you with must-read coverage of Israel and the Jewish world.
During the time this settlement was under the control of Russian armed forces, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions, the ministry says.
Photo and video of corpses strewn across the streets of Bucha were another production of the Kyiv regime for the Western media, it adds.
