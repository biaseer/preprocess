Explosions are being reported on the outskirts of Kyiv as the city braces for an expected Russian assault on Ukraines capital.

Earlier, a senior US defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagons assessment, said that the Russians were using long-range fire to hit civilian targets inside Kyiv with increasing frequency but that their ground forces were making little to no progress around the country. The official said Russian troops were still about 15 kilometers 9 miles from the center of the capital.
Air raid sirens have been going off in the city regularly. The blasts come as the city begins a planned 35-hour curfew.
