The Antonov 225, which was the largest plane in the world, was destroyed by Russia on the first day of fighting last month, as it attacked the Hostomel airport in Kyivs northwest. The Antonov plant in Sviatoshyn also has an airfield, according to Google Maps, meaning Russian forces may try to secure it as a bridgehead for attacking Kyiv.

Pictures being shared on social media appear to show a large fire on Kyivs outskirts after an Antonov aircraft factory in the north of the city was apparently hit by Russian artillery.
A second video from a person on the street shows the fire rising up from buildings that match the large Antonov plant in Kyivs Sviatoshyn neighborhood.
