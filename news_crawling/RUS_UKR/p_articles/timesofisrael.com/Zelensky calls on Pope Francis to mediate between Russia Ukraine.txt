Negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have held ongoing talks aimed at ending nearly four weeks of fierce fighting, but have failed to announce any progress so far.
Zelensky says he had held a telephone call with the pope and that he had told His Holiness about the difficult humanitarian situation and the blocking of rescue corridors by Russian troops.
The mediating role of the Holy See in ending human suffering would be appreciated, Zelensky writes on Twitter following the call.
