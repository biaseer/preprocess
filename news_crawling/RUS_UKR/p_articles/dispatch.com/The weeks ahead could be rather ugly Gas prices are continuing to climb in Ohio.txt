With tensions still very high that Russia may invade Ukraine, gasoline prices kept moving higher, tugged by the rising price of oil as the market concentrates on possible outcomes from the situation that could affect global oil production amidst recovering demand,Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy said in a press release. However, with nuclear talks between Iran and global powers ongoing in Vienna, the possibility exists that a new deal could bring Irans crude oil supply back to legitimate markets, helping to ease a slight portion of supply concerns."

Gas prices have hit their highest average in Ohio since September 2014, according to a study from GasBuddy.
"While the proposition remains in the air for the time being, were also just a few weeks away from the traditional start of the spring surge in gasoline prices, brought on by the change to summer gasoline, seasonal maintenance at refineries and rising demand," he said."The weeks ahead could be rather ugly with rising prices, especially if Russia pursues a strong-arm invasion of Ukraine.
Prices currently average $3.33 in the state, which is lower than the national average of $3.52.The national average is up 20.7 cents from a month ago and 88.9 cents per gallon higher than a year ago.
De Haan added that a traditional rise in gas during the spring season could drive gas prices even higher.
