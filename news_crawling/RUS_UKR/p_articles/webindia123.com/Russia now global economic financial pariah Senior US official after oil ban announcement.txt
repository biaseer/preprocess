"It also bans new US investment in Russia's energy sector, which will ensure that American companies and investors are not underwriting Putin's efforts to expand Russian energy production," he added.
America is united in its resolve to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said a senior US administration official, adding that "there's broad support across the country for degrading the strength of Putin's economy and war machine through curb on energy exports".
Explaining the mechanics of the ban, the official said that the move blocks any new purchases of Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, and coal, and winds down the deliveries of existing purchases that have already been contracted for.
The official further said that this announcement builds on unprecedented economic costs the US and its allies and partners have imposed on Russia.
Earlier on Tuesday local time, Biden announced a ban on the US import of Russian energy in a bid to ramp up sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine.
"Russian oil was just under 10 per cent of our overall imports of oil but accounts for a third of Europe's imports. As of last year, Europe imports more than six times more oil from Russia than we do -- about four and a half million barrels for Europe versus seven hundred thousand barrels for the US per day," he added.
Enumerating the various economic sanctions imposed against Russia, the official said that Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.  "Over 30 counties, representing well over half the world's economy, have announced immediate sanctions, with debilitating economic costs on Russia, cutting off its access to high technology, stunting growth and weakening its military for years to come," he added.

The official further informed that the Americans will also be prohibited from participating in foreign investments in the Russian energy sector.
