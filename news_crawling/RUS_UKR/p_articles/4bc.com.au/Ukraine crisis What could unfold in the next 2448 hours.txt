Vladimir Putin has the chance to stop at any moment if he feels that hes done enough or things are looking a little too dangerous, but judging by the behaviour of the Western leaders, the expectation is there is going to be a full on invasion.
Executive Director at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Peter Jennings, said it was clear the government had received intelligence suggesting an imminent invasion.
I assume that means an attack on the capital Kiev, and an attempt to decapitate the current Ukrainian political leadership to install a puppet regime, I think those are the sorts of things we could see unfolding in the next 24-48 hours.
He also warned of a full-scale invasion is likely to occur within the next 24 hours.
