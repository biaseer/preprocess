Before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, it recognised two parts of eastern Ukraine as sovereign states: the so-called peoples republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. That recognition is now central to what both Russia and the West are saying about the invasion.
Why does this kind of state recognition matter so much, and how does it challenge international law  can you just occupy a parcel of land inhabited by dissidents and call it a new country? The answer of course is no, it is illegal. Many states have pointed this out, including the United States and Australia.
