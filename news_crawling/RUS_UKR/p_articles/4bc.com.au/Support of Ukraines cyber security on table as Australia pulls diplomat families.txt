We have been discussing with the Ukraine support in the cyber context, Foreign Minister Marise Payne told Neil Breen.
Ms Payne said Australia has ruled out intervening with military action as Russian forces gather at the Ukrainian border.
Russian hackers are believed to be the source of a massive cyber attack, which targeted dozens of Ukrainian government websites on January 14.
We certainly do see authoritarian regimes trying to test the resolve of countries like Australia, who are liberal democracies, but also countries around the world, no matter what their political system.
Cyber security and cyber affairs are an issue on which we have worked with Ukraine previously.
We do not accept that as a mode of operation and we will call it out and we will oppose it wherever we see it.
