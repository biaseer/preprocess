Over several years in 10 Downing Street I collected advice for my son, Charlie, wrote the former ambassador on Twitter.
Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev penned an emotional letter to a young boy encouraging him to live a life that makes a difference.
I asked world leaders what they would say to themselves at 14 years old. Mikhail Gorbachev was quite emotional as he wrote this. His translator helped too. Here it is. RIP.
The letter was shared by Britain's former ambassador to Lebanon, Thomas Fletcher, who revealed the advice was written during his time as a foreign policy and Northern Ireland adviser in Downing Street.
Mr Gorbachev, who died aged 91 on Tuesday, advised the teenager that "the success you take will ultimately be equal to what you put in" in the note written in 2008.
The note, which was signed M Gorbachev and dated June 6, 2008, stated: Dear Charlie, by the time you read this I may no longer be around, but I wish you a successful and joyful life.
Mr Gorbachev, who brought down the Iron Curtain by introducing Glasnost and Perestroika to the Soviet Union, was famously the Soviet leader with whom Margaret Thatcher said she could do business.
