The call which lasted an hour and two minutes produced no fundamental change in the dynamics and the situation on Ukraines borders suggests no evidence of de-escalation, or interest in de-escalation.
That word had been given in 1994 when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons programme, in return for a guarantee from the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia to respect its borders and sovereignty.
American warnings of "swift and severe costs" should Russia further encroach Ukrainian territory seemingly not enough to deter.
The chance for more diplomacy was not ruled out, nor was the risk of war.
When Russian adventurism threatened Ukraine in 2014, then-Vice President Biden was made President Obamas point man.
His trip then was not enough to protect those borders. His call today may not be either.
Todays call is one of the many they have shared at times of global crisis.
He travelled to Moscow to meet directly with Mr Putin, his belief then likely the same as his belief now. That big countries ought not to beat up smaller ones, especially when they had given their word not to.
