More than 100 people gathered under sunny skies Sunday in the Elgin Civic Center Plaza to show their solidarity for Ukrainians suffering under the dark cloud of Russia's invasion.
"We can stand together today in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Ukraine who are losing loved ones and their peace and their safety and their freedom," said the Rev. Thea Kornelius, pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Elgin.
The vigil, hosted by the Coalition of Elgin Religious Leaders and the Elgin Symphony Orchestra, featured performances from orchestra musicians and speakers discussing the human toll of the war.
Besides their show of support, organizers shared information with attendees on how to help the victims of the war.
