I am fed up with the European Union and the United Nations.The United Nations is all talk with no action. The Russians have put the "butcher of Syria" in charge now so you ain't see nothing yet.Ukrainianpeople have proven that they can defeat Russia, but the EU countries will not give Ukraine the tanks, heavy artillery, land-to-sea missiles, patriot missiles unless we, the U.S.,backfill theirold weapons with newer weapons.Really!
Prayer is needed now, along with weapons now.Please, put pressure on the European Union to admit Ukraine right now as a member. Show some guts for a change.China is sending weapons to Russia andSyria is sending mercenaries oh, but no one can drive a tank over the Polish border to Ukraine? The West has let Putin dictatethe rules just like ChinaRussia did in Vietnam. When will the West learn? War is war, period.
Sanctions will not prevent people being slaughtered get off your hypocrite backsides and give these people what they need now before Russia comes after you.Do you think China isn't taking notes now when it wants to attack Taiwan? Also, how many of these Ukrainianwomen and children will be soldinto prostitution and other horrible things that horrify me?
