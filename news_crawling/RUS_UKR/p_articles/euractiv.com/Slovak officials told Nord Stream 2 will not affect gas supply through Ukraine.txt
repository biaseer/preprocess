Miller assured that Gazprom is still interested in continuing cooperation with Slovakia, Korok wrote on Facebook. In terms of mutual trade balance, Russia has long been our 9th most important partner, he added. Irena Jenov  EURACTIV.sk
Alexei Miller explained in detail the reasons for building Nord Stream 2 as an alternative to Jamal Europa 1 and Jamal Europa 2, which run through Poland. This is confirmed by the fact that Russia has concluded a new gas transit agreement with Ukraine by 2024, Sulk said.

The project would allow additional Russian gas to flow directly to Germany. Proponents argue the pipeline is a commercial investment that is key to Europes supply security, while opponents criticise Nord Stream 2 on environmental, geopolitical, and security grounds.
Board Chairman of Russias state-run natural gas monopoly Gazprom, Alexei Miller, confirmed that Slovakia has a stable position in Gazproms strategic plans in the meeting at the 24th International Economic Forum SPIEF with Slovak Economy Minister Richard Sulk and Foreign Minister Ivan Korok in St. Petersburg on Friday.
If Nord Stream 2 is completed and transit is diverted away from Ukraine, the available border capacity between Ukraine and neighbouring EU states may shrink, limiting the possibility for European companies to import and store gas in Ukraine.
