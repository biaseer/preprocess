Earlier this month, Premier Jason Kenney announced they will remove the Provincial Fuel Tax so Albertans can have some relief at the pumps. With the removal of the fuel tax, it will drop the price of gas by 13 cents.
But we may even see afurther drop as the price of crude oil is changing. On Monday and Tuesday, prices of crude oil per barrel werearound $106 when they were sitting steady at $115.
With April 1fast approaching, Albertansmight get to enjoy some gas prices that may be lower than what will be taken off because of the provincial fuel tax.
Even though we are seeing a drop in crude oil prices, it's still up 40 per cent compared to last year.
The recent drop in price is tied to peace talks between Russia and Ukraine andpandemic issues in China as their largest city, Shanghai has entered a lockdown.
Also, on April 1 the Federal Carbon Tax increase comes into play which will add about 2 cents to the price of fuel.
