Russian forces have yet to reach central Kyiv but the capital already bears scars of artillery fire. A convoy of military vehicles up to 40 miles long has been stalled on the outskirts of the city for the past few weeks.
From the besieged city of Kharkiv in the north east to Lviv in the west, few places have escaped damage in the first 30 days of the war. The humanitarian crisis borne as a result of the conflict is well documented, with more than three million residents forced to flee to neighbouring countries.
Although far from the front line, the western city of Lviv has also been targeted by Russia. This image shows smoke rising near the city's airport after missiles hit an aviation repair plant.
Locals in Irpin destroyed their main bridge to Kyiv in a bid to stop Russian forces from advancing on the capital. Routes were kept clear to enable people to flee on foot.
Here we take a look at images of some of Ukraine's biggest cities taken before and after the invasion. Use the sliders to reveal more.
Kharkiv in north eastern Ukraine has become one of the front lines of the war. This image shows a local government building in the city's central square after it was shelled by Russian troops earlier this month.
More than a month of bombardment from Russian forces has laid waste to cities across Ukraine. Missile strikes and heavy artillery have flattened communities indiscriminately as Vladimir Putin's military continues its assault.
