Six KC-135 Stratotankers from the 100th Aerial Refueling Wing at RAF Mildenhall in England also deployed to Germanys Ramstein Air Base on Monday, the command said.
The F-35s are in Europe temporarily to increase the collective defense of NATO, Capt. Erik Anthony, a command spokesman, said Thursday.
The latest deployment augments the seven F-35s stationed at RAF Lakenheath. The bases new F-35 squadron, the first in Europe, welcomed its first four jets in December. It received three more last week, Anthony said.
It comes on the heels of the arrival Monday of eight F-15Es from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C., in the Polish town of Lask, USAFE-AFAFRICA said in a statement. In addition, the Air Force sent eight F-15 Eagle fighter jets to Poland last week.
Unlike last weeks arrival of four B-52 Stratofortress aircraft at Britains RAF Fairford, the deployment to Spangdahlem had not been planned as part of a regular rotation, U.S. Air Forces in EuropeAir Forces Africa officials said.
KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany  The Air Force has deployed a dozen F-35A Lightning II fighter jets and about 350 personnel to Germany as tensions continue between Russia and the West over the Kremlins military buildup around Ukraine.
But NATO responded Tuesday that it has not seen any evidence of a de-escalation. More than 150,000 Russian troops are estimated by U.S. officials to be amassed near Ukraine.
We are facing a dynamic environment, and this deployment significantly enhances our support to NATOs defenses, Gen. Jeff Harrigian, the commander of USAFE-AFAFRICA and Allied Air Command, said in a statement, referring to the F-35 jets in Germany.
The string of deployments comes amid ongoing fears of a new Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin claimed earlier this week that it had started to pull back troops from the border with Ukraine.
