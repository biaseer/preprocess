The current events have nothing to do with a desire to infringe on the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. They are connected with defending Russia from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and are trying to use it against our country.
People living in territories which are part of todays Ukraine were not asked how they want to build their lives when the USSR was created or after WW2. People living in todays Ukraine, anyone who want to do this, must be able to enjoy this right to make a free choice.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine to defend separatists in the east of the country, called the Donbas region. I have made the decision of a military operation, he said in a surprise statement on television shortly before 6 am.
