Ukraine requested an urgent United Nations Security Council UNSC Meet after Heads of these regions asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for help.
We call for immediate de-escalation and refraining from any further action that could contribute to a worsening of the situation. We call on all parties to exert greater efforts to bridge divergent interests, he said, adding that the legitimate security interests of all parties should be taken into account.
Indias Permanent Representative to the United Nations TS Tirumurti made this statement in the backdrop of Russia ordering troops into Ukraines breakaway regions Donetsk and Luhansk.
He further informed that India is facilitating the return of all Indian nationals, including students residing in different parts of Ukraine.
Emphasising the need for all sides to maintain peace and security by exercising restraint, Tirumurti said that the solution lies in sustained diplomatic dialogue between the concerned parties.
Reiterating Indias call for immediate de-escalation of tensions, Tirumurti said, The situation is in danger of spiralling into a major crisis. We express our deep concern over the developments, which if not handled carefully, may well undermine the peace and security of the region.
