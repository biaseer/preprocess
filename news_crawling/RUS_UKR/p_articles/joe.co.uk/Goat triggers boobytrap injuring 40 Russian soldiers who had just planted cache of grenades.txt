In a statement via Sky News, Ukraine's chief intelligence directorate said: "As a result of the goat's 'chaotic' movements, the animal 'disposed of' several grenades.
But these were set off when an escaped goat from a nearby farm wandered towards the area and triggered a tripwire set up by the soldiers.
The animal has been labelled the 'goat of Kyiv' in a reference to a the mythical pilot the 'Ghost of Kyiv' which captured headlines earlier in the conflict.
According to local officials, roughly 60 percent of Zaporizhzhia is now under the control of Russian forces. The region has been under heavy shelling since the start of the conflict in February.
At least 40 soldiers were injured in the explosion, but the fate of the goat is not yet known.
Dozens of Russian troops have been injured near the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia after a booby trap of grenades was set off - by a goat.
"As a result of a chain reaction, several Russians sustained injuries of varying degrees of severity."
According to Ukraine's chief intelligence directorate, the incident took place in the village ofKinski Rozdory inZaporizhzhia Oblast.
The agency claimed Kremlin troops had installed pinned grenades around a local hospital in the village as a "circular defence."
