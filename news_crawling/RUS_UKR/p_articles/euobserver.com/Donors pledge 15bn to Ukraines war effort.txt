Donors at an international conference in Denmark pledged over 1.5bn to boost Ukraine's military capabilities in its war against Russia. The pledges were made by 26 countries.

We are increasing the amount of aid to Ukraine," said Ben Wallace, UK's secretary of state for defence, who-costed the conference alongside with Danish defence minister Morten Bdskov.
