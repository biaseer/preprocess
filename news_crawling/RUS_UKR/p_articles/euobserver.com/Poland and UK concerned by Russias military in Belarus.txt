Poland and the UK said on Thursday that they were "deeply concerned" by the changes to Russia's military presence in Belarus, without giving details. In a joint statement, they pledged to step up "urgent military aid" and training to Ukraine and find a solution to ensure the "Russian war machine" cannot benefit from the trade of energy supplies. Warsaw and London will also continue to host Ukrainians fleeing the war.
