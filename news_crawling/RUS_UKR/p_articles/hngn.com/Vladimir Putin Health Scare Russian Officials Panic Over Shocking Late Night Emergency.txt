General SVR has previously alleged that Putin is being treated for cancer in secret and that senior advisor Nikolai Patrushev frequently fills in for him during operations. None of the channel's accusations have been verified, but if proven, Putin would not be the first Russian leader to utilize a decoy.
He may be replaced by a body double, or deepfakes, who will impersonate him while he recovers from the unknown ailment, according to The Sun. It comes only days after Ukraine's spy head said that Putin was a dummy during a state visit to Iran. Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, expressed concern after seeing a video of Russian President Vladimir Putin stepping off an aircraft in Tehran on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, according to a recent story, the Kremlin controls the air conditioning surrounding Russian President Vladimir Putin to keep him from getting a cold. Putin's health has been under scrutiny in recent months, particularly after launching the invasion of Ukraine in late February.
Rumors concerning Putin's health have surfaced during his invasion of Ukraine, most recently last week when a video showing Putin's arm appearing to be immobile aroused concern about his health. Some wondered if his arm wasn't moving because of a medical ailment, but experts claimed it may be due to his KGB training, which trained him to maintain his right arm ready to draw a rifle at all times.
This happened late on Friday into Saturday morning, as medical personnel raced to his bedside. According to the General SVR channel, the medical personnel stayed with the dictator for around three hours.
While leading the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin is claimed to have utilized many body duplicates, two of whom have subsequently come forward to tell about their experiences. One man, solely identified as 'Rashid,' said he was one of the numerous persons hired by the KGB to stand in for Stalin during public appearances where he was fearful of being killed, or to give the people the impression he was healthy while he was ill.
Recent reports reveal that Russian President Vladimir Putin needed paramedics at his bedside after suffering a serious health crisis over the weekend.  Vladimir Putin suffered from extreme nausea while being monitored for his health.
The statements come only days after the latest health concerns for Putin were raised when he was observed coughing during a meeting with Iranian government leaders, though Putin attempted to downplay the coughing, claiming it was caused by sitting near an air conditioner to escape the high heat in Iran's capital.
Russian authorities have dismissed allegations that Putin has any health problems. Peskov referred to them as ducks, a Russian metaphor for hearsay, last week, and rumors regarding his health have not accumulated enough proof to be declared verifiably genuine, as per Newsweek.
People have expressed fear that the president, who is under fire for the crisis, is suffering from a variety of ailments, though the Kremlin has dismissed any rumors that he is unwell. According to a recent report from state-controlled Russia Today, Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov informed reporters that the Kremlin retains control over the air conditioning around their president so that he does not get sick amid hot temperatures in Moscow.
Felix Dadaev then came forward in 2008 to claim he was another of those doubles, claiming Putin's regime had permitted him to tell his story through state media. Putin himself admitted he considered using decoys for protection during the Chechen War, but claims he dismissed the idea and it was never carried out. It said that a decision was reached that "he will be replaced by a double" in various events this week, Daily Mailreported.
Others have expressed concern about his health as well. British journalist John Sweeney, who has long followed Putin, stated in his new book Killer in the Kremlin that he has seen changes in Putin's appearance, characterizing him as appearing "like a hamster" because of his swollen cheeks.
