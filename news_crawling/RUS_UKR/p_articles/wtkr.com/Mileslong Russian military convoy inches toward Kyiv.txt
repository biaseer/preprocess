CNN and Politico report that satellite images show a 40-plus mile convoy of Russian tanks and armored vehicles is inching closer to Kyiv. The military equipment is approaching from Belarus, where thousands of Russian troops were stationed before the invasion.
Dmytro Zhyvytskyy posted photographs of the charred shell of a four-story building and rescuers searching rubble. In a later Facebook post, he said many Russian soldiers and some local residents also were killed during the fighting on Sunday.
Ukrainian fighters are putting up fierce resistance, and surprisingly, Russia has not been able to dominate the skies.
Russia's military assault on Ukraine is now in its sixth day as a miles-long Russian military convoy threatens Ukraine's capital.
But civilians continue to bear the brunt of the war. Families and children are huddling in underground subway stations and other shelters.
The reports come as local outlets say more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed after Russian artillery recently hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv.
Fighting has intensified on the ground as Russia stepped up shelling of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.
