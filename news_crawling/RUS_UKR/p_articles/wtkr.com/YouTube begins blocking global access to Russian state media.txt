Ukraines digital transformation minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, predicted in his Telegram channel that the Kremlin would soon move to block YouTube in Russia. Its a question of time.
YouTube previously paused YouTube ads in Russia. Now, it is extending that to all the ways it makes money on the platform in Russia.
BOSTON  YouTube announced on Friday that it has begun blocking access globally to channels associated with Russian state-funded media. It had previously blocked them, specifically RT and Sputnik, across Europe.
YouTube also said it was now removing content about Russias invasion of Ukraine that violates its policy that minimizes or trivializes well-documented violent events. The Kremlin refers to the invasion as a special military operation and not a war.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, announced the move in a Twitter post and said that while the change is effective immediately, we expect our systems to take time to ramp up.
