Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during his late Saturday night address that Russia's aggression was never limited to just Ukraine and the whole of Europe was a target.      Zelensky urged the West to impose a complete embargo on Russian energy products and to supply Ukraine with additional weapons.  He said Russia's use of force was "a catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone".      Zelensky said Ukraine is ready for a tough battle, as Russian forces were massing in the east of the country. But he added: "This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war."      Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said President Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin would not meet until after Russia was defeated in the east.      As Ukraine reels from a missile attack on a train station that left at least 55 people dead and scores more injured, President Zelenskyy suggested Russia's invasion has been enabled by lucrative gas and oil exports that even some of its harshest critics find irresistible.      Following U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's visit to Ukraine Friday, Zelenskyy said in a video message, "Oil in particular is one of the ... sources of Russian arrogance, their feeling of impunity."      On March 8th, the U.K. government said it would phase out imports of Russian oil over the course of 2022. The same day the administration of President Joe Biden said it would ban Russian oil, liquified natural gas, and coal.      The European Union, however, has not been as steadfast, arguing that a total and rapid ban on Russian fossil fuels could send the continent into a recession.
