WASHINGTON - A senior Biden administration official said Wednesday that Russia has added as many as 7,000 troops at the border with Ukraine, characterizing claims by Moscow that it was withdrawing forces as false.    We have now confirmed that in the last several days, Russia has increased its troop presence along the Ukrainian border by as many as 7,000 troops, with some arriving as recently as today," the official told reporters on a call Wednesday evening.    Every indication we have now is they mean only to publicly offer to talk and make claims about de-escalation while privately mobilizing for war, the official said, adding that the U.S. is receiving indications that Russia could launch a false pretext to justify an invasion of Ukraine at any moment.     The comments directly challenge Russian statements about pulling back some forces and being willing to engage in diplomacy over the past 24 hours.    U.S. and European officials have said they have seen no signs of Russia de-escalating the situation, despite a statement by Russia on Tuesday that it was pulling back troops.    We continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during an appearance on ABCs Good Morning America on Wednesday.    Officials did not elaborate on the intelligence supporting the estimate that Russia has added as many as 7,000 troops to the border with Ukraine.    In a speech Tuesday afternoon, President Biden welcomed the Russian statement that Moscow would pull back forces but said it had not been verified. He warned Russian President Vladimir Putin against invading Ukraine but vowed to give diplomacy "every chance to succeed" in diffusing the crisis.  Source: The Hill
