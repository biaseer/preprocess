As Russia launched its invasion, the U.S. gave Ukrainian forces detailed intelligence about exactly when and where Russian missiles and bombs were intended to strike, prompting Ukraine to move air defenses and aircraft out of harms way, current and former U.S. officials told NBC News.         That near real-time intelligence-sharing also paved the way for Ukraine to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of troops in the early days of the war, the officials say, helping repel a Russian assault on a key airport near Kyiv.         The details about the air defenses and the transport plane, which have not previously been reported, underscore why, two months into the war, officials assess that intelligence from U.S. spy agencies and the Pentagon has been an important factor in helping Ukraine thwart Russias effort to seize most of the country.          In a statement, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said, We are regularly providing detailed, timely intelligence to the Ukrainians on the battlefield to help them defend their country against Russian aggression and will continue to do so.         Germanys government has reversed course and authorized the supply of about 50 anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, in a major policy shift.  Berlin's decision comes as the US and its allies met at an airbase in Germany to pledge more weapons for Ukraine.         Speaking after a meeting with the UN's secretary general in Moscow, Vladimir Putin tried to justify invading Ukraine but claimed to have hopes for a diplomatic solution.
