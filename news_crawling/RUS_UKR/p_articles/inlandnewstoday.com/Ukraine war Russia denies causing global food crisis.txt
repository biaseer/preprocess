CAIRO - Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, on a diplomatic offensive in Egypt, has dismissed claims that Moscow is causing the global food crisis.    In a speech to Arab League ambassadors in Cairo, he said Western nations were distorting the truth about the impact of sanctions on global food security.    He accused Western nations of trying to impose their dominance over others.    Much of the Arab world and Africa is badly affected by grain shortages caused by Russia's war in Ukraine.    A landmark deal signed on Friday to resume Ukraine's grain exports hangs in the balance after Russia attacked targets in the port of Odesa on Saturday.    Lavrov said that Western nations' "aggressiveness" in imposing sanctions on Russia indicated one simple conclusion: "It is not about Ukraine, it is about the future of the world order.  "They say everybody must support a rules-based world order, and the rules are written depending on what specific situation the West wants to resolve in its own favor."    Egypt has significant ties with Russia, which supplies wheat, weapons and - until the invasion of Ukraine began - large numbers of tourists.
