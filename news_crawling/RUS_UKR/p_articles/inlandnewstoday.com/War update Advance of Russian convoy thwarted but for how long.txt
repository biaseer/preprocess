Attacks by the Ukrainian military and botched planning have stalled a massive Russian convoy inching toward the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, while Russian forces advance in the south, seeking to take a key city that can facilitate further attacks, U.S. officials say.       After claiming the city of Kherson, the Russian military is looking to take Mykolaiv, a location that would allow them to support any future amphibious landings at Odessa, a major prize on Ukraines Black Sea coast, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Biden administration.       In southeast Ukraine, the Russian assault  with siege tactics and mass shelling  on Mariupol, a heavily fortified city of 430,000, could be a dismal harbinger of things to come for other major metropolitan areas.       Meantime, Ukraine and Russia say they have agreed to temporary local cease-fires to create humanitarian corridors so civilians can be evacuated and food and medicine can be delivered, the Washington Post reports.
