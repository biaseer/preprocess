The desire to live according to ones will, to choose ones own path and follow it, has become part of the genetic code of our people, he said.
In a video address marking National Flag Day on Monday, the Russian President did not mention Russias six-month-old military operation in Ukraine, but echoed some of the justifications cited for sending in troops.
Vladimir Putin has lauded Russias flag as a symbol of a country determined to defend its interests and remain loyal to traditional values.
He also said Russian schools, beginning in September, will open their school weeks with flag-raising ceremonies and singing of the national anthem.
Mr Putin and other officials have said Russia sent troops into Ukraine effectively as a protective measure against the encroaching West.
We are firm in pursuing in the international arena only those policies that meet the fundamental interests of the motherland.
