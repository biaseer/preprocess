On May 4, 2022, Tupperware announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Among other items, Tupperware reported adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations and net sales that fell well short of consensus estimates and withdrew its full year 2022 guidance and named a new Chief Financial Officer. Tupperware attributed the poor performance to the conflict in Russia and Ukraine. However, when pressed by analysts on a conference call, Tupperware acknowledged that Russia and Ukraine only accounted for 2 of its revenue. On this news, Tupperware's stock price fell by more than 32, damaging investors.
