BEIJING, China: While visiting the Xinjiang region, where his government is widely accused of oppressing predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities, Chinese president Xi Jinping endorsed the continuing implementation of his ruling Communist Party's approach in the region.His policies have come under harsh criticism from the U.S. and many European countries.After an outburst of deadly separatist violence, Chinese authorities have cracked down on Xinjiang's Uyghur and Kazakh communities, with analysts saying hundreds of thousands and likely a million or more people have been detained in prison-like indoctrination camps.Last week, the official Xinhua News Agency reported that Xi stressed that social stability and lasting security are the government's overarching goals.Meanwhile, critics have described the crackdown as cultural genocide.According to Xinhua, during an "inspection tour" Xi said that the principle that Islam in China must be Chinese in orientation is to be upheld, and while the needs of religious believers should be ensured, they should be united closely to the Communist Party and the government.Educating and guiding people of all ethnic groups should also be done to strengthen their identification with the Chinese nation, culture and Communist Party, he added.Xinjiang is a "core area and a hub" in China's program of building ports, railways and power stations connecting it to economies reaching from Central Asia to Eastern Europe, Xi said.The U.S. has blocked some exports of cotton and other products from the region due to reports of forced labor.Xinjiang borders Russia, Afghanistan and Central Asia, which, through economic incentives and security alliances, China has aimed to draw within its sphere of influence.
