Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday raised the possibility of eastern European partners sending older, Russia-made weapons systems to Ukraine.
Germany cannot send Panzerhaubitze 2000 tanks itself because its army does not have the stocks, Lambrecht said. But where we can provide training, we will do that.
Asked whether Germany really could not deliver heavy weapons from Bundeswehr stocks, Lambrecht said this was impossible if I want to continue to guarantee national and allied defense.
But the government has said that after decades of chronic underinvestment, the Bundeswehr German army is simply not in a position to send the weapons Ukraine wants.
The deliveries must happen quickly because military experts agree that the next two weeks will be decisive in Ukraines fight against Russia, she said.
In the future, we must be much better equipped. We must no longer allow the Bundeswehr to be cut down to the point where we are in the situation we are in at the moment, she said.
Lambrecht also said Germany would train Ukrainian soldiers to use German-made Panzerhaubitze 2000 tanks  reportedly due to be sent by the Netherlands.
Germany has come under fire for refusing to send heavy weapons to Ukraine, even as allies such as the United States, Britain, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands up their deliveries.
Germany has reached an agreement with eastern European partners to supply Ukraine with a new batch of heavy weapons in the next few days, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said on Thursday.
Its about tanks, armored vehicles, or other options individual countries are able to give, Lambrecht told the NTV broadcaster.
