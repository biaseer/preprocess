As the inaugural war-crimes case in Ukraine, Shishimarins prosecution was being watched closely. Investigators have been collecting evidence of possible war crimes to bring before the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Seargeant Vadim Shishimarin could get life in prison for allegedly shooting a a 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through an open car window in the northeastern Sumy region on February 28, four days into the invasion.
KYIV, Ukraine AP  A 21-year-old Russian soldier facing the first war crimes trial since Moscow invaded Ukraine pleaded guilty Wednesday to killing an unarmed civilian.
The ... accused Shishimarin fully admitted the guilt of the crime in accordance with all circumstances established during the pre-trial investigation and announced by the prosecution during the trial today, prosecutor Yaroslav Uschapivskyi said.
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova previously said her office was readying war crimes cases against 41 Russian soldiers for offenses that included bombing civilian infrastructure, killing civilians, rape and looting.
It was not immediately clear how many of the suspects are in Ukrainian hands and how many would be tried in absentia.
Victor Ovsyanikov, Shishimarins attorney, said Wednesday that despite the guilty plea he believed the soldiers actions were wrongly qualified.
Shishimarin was instructed to shoot a civilian by a person who wasnt his direct commander or a person whose instructions he was obliged to follow, Uschapivskyi added. So its not correct to say that there was some sort of order.
Shishimarin, a captured member of a Russian tank unit, was prosecuted under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war.
