Addressing a news conference with the Dutch and Canadian prime ministers, he said he would be setting out an "energy supply strategy" for the UK in the coming days.
Boris Johnson has said Europe needs to move away from its reliance on Russian hydrocarbons.
Mr Johnson said it had to ensure there was a "substitute supply" and there would be more use of nuclear power and "much more use" of renewable energy.
