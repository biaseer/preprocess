Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Javid drew comparisons between war in Ukraine and genocide in Bosnia in the 90s. He said, "I don't want to be commemorating another genocide in Europe."
The UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid has condemned the actions of Russia in Ukraine saying, "To call it a violation of human rights is to put it mildly".
