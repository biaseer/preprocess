Mr Johnson said the UK "cannot and will not just look away", and there would be a "massive package of economic sanctions" designed to "hobble" the Russian economy.
The prime minister was speaking from Downing Street as Russia started an invasion of Ukraine.
Boris Johnson has said the "hideous and barbaric venture" of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine "must end in failure".
