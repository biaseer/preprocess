Russia has claimed that neo-Nazism is rife in Ukraine - a claim that's been dismissed by Kyiv and Western nations as baseless.
Russia's foreign minister says his troops will respond to the UK and US sending long-range missiles to Ukraine, by pushing back Ukrainian forces further.
"The longer the range of the weapons that the West supplies, the further we will push back the line from which Neo-Nazis can threaten the Russian Federation," Sergei Lavrov told a news conference, responding to a question from BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg.
