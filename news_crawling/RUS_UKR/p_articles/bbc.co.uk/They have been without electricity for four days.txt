The resident, who has been in the UK for 19 years, is Latvian born, but her entire family are north east of Kyiv.
"From time to time there was a neighbour. They have a generator yeah, so they charge the phone that text... and say... 'we're alive'.
Kate showed the BBC a video of the remains of a neighbour's house, which was demolished.
Kate said there were Russian soldiers at a bridge and people "can't go out, so nobody in, nobody out."
A Hereford woman says she feels helpless after her family's village in Ukraine was bombed by Russian troops.
"But I can't go inside and help them and take them from there. It's no chance. It's not possible and that is the worst thing... You don't know what to do, how to help."
Asked about a family video she had seen, she said: "It's like a second home. I can't believe it. I've been on that street. I walk on that street."
Kate's uncle, cousins and godson, who are sleeping in shelters and cellars, have no electricity or running water and are running out of food.
