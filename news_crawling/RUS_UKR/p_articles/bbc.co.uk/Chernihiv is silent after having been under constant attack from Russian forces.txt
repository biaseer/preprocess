People in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv were under constant attack from Russian forces  until suddenly, they withdrew.
The BBC's Stephanie Hegarty has spoken to Juli, a volunteer who helps distribute food and humanitarian aid there. She recorded a video diary during the weeks that the city was partially surrounded, when large parts of it were destroyed.
No-one really believes that the Russians have gone for good, she says, and that means the silence itself is scary.
