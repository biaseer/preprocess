WASHINGTON, D.C. WKZO AMFM U.S. Rep. Fred Upton R-St. Joseph issued the following statement after Russian forces officially invaded Ukraine:
It is my hope that this invasion is swiftly dealt with, and casualties are kept to an absolute minimum. This is an important global test of democratic values, and we must not fail.
Today, Russias authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. I was hoping for a diplomatic resolution, but Putin rejected diplomacy and chose war. The US must continue to support our ally Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression through knee-buckling economic sanctions targeting Putin and his cronies, including cutting off Russia from the international banking system. Our international allies must join the US in imposing severe sanctions as to not give the aggressor any sort of fiscal relief. Germanys suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a much-needed show of support but must be followed by continuing waves of sanctions. We must also continue to support and supply Ukraine with the necessary equipment to defend themselves. This truly requires an all-hands-on-deck approach supplemented by strong NATO and EU forces working to defeat Russia both militarily and fiscally.
The President has many tools readily available, such as economic sanctions, that I strongly encourage the President to continue to uphold. However, if the Biden Administration wishes to send US troops to Ukraine in lieu of a formal declaration of war they must first obtain Congressional authorization for the use of military force  not a hasty executive order that would put thousands of American lives at risk without a Congressional consensus.
