At the train station in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, EU passengers are allowed to get off the train but the Russian passengers must stay on it.
As one of the transit trains passed through the station on Friday, a passenger was seen making an obscene hand gesture at the photographs.
An exhibition of shocking images from attacks in Ukraine has opened at a train station in Lithuania with the aim of giving Russian transit travellers a true picture of the conflict.
The new exhibition of 24 photos has been set up on the platform used by the transit trains on Friday, with the images placed at the height of the carriage windows.
A group of Lithuanians earlier this month launched a campaign for Russian diaspora volunteers to call home phone numbers within Russia and speak to people about the attacks.
The transit arrangement has continued despite numerous sanctions on air travel against Russia since President Vladimir Putin gave the order for Russian forces to attack Ukraine on February 24.
"We want to spread the message widely that there is no escape from reality in a free country," he said.
"Today, Putin is killing the peaceful population of Ukraine. Do you approve of this?," read the inscription on some of the pictures exhibited.
"We have selected images that emotionally convey the grim reality faced by the people of Ukraine," said Jonas Staselis, head of the Lithuanian Press Photographers Club who helped organise the exhibit.
