The West remains divided over the extent of its support for Ukraine in its defence against Russia's months-long incursion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said.
Zelenskyy said Ukraine was grateful for support from US President Joe Biden but said resolve was lagging closer to home.
"We are on the European continent and we need the support of a united Europe," he added.

Kiev has called for greater support, membership to the US-led NATO military alliance, and for a no-fly zone to be imposed over the country.
He also pointed to a lack of consensus over Sweden and Finland's historic bid to join NATO. "Is there this unity regarding the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO? No, no. So, is there a strong joint West? No," the Ukrainian leader said.
"Unity is about weapons. My question is, is there this unity in practice? I can't see it. Our huge advantage over Russia would be when we are truly united," Zelenskyy said during a panel discussion on Ukraine at the World Economic Forum.
Zelenskyy specifically named neighbouring Hungary, which has voiced opposition to a European Union-wide embargo on Russian oil, another key Ukrainian demand.
Washington and European countries have poured billions of dollars' worth of arms into Ukraine to help the country's outgunned forces beat back the better-armed Russian forces.
