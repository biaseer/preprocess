The offensive has drawn international outrage, with the EU, US, and UK, among others, implementing tough financial sanctions on Moscow.
This message is relayed daily by state TV channels. Russia made it a criminal offence to publish "false" information about its armed forces.
Pro-Kremlin pollsters that have already published their findings also showedPutin's approval rating at above 80 percent.
Levada said 15 percent of respondents said they did not approve  down from 27 percent  and 2 percent said they had no opinion.
The Russian government and its Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin also improved their approval ratings, the Levada poll showed.
Vladimir Putin's ratings have seen a boost since the start of military actions in Ukraine, with over 80 percent of Russians saying they support the Russian president's actions.
Putin launched a military operation on February 24 in Ukraine citing the "genocide" of Russian speakers there and accusing the pro-Western country of close ties with NATO, which Moscow perceives as a threat to its Western borders.
The first poll conducted by the independent Levada Centre since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, said on Thursday that 83 percent of Russians approve of Putin's actions, up from 71 percent in early February.
