The Lochcarron-based potter said: I wanted to do something to support the humanitarian aid effort in Ukraine after being devastated by the unfolding crisis.
There have been lots of volunteers helping. From regular pottery learners to visitors, they have been rolling the clay out, stamping, cutting, cleaning, painting and tying strings on. Some people have got very creative in their designs.
I thought hearts would be something that would be quick and straightforward to make. I was looking to do something that other people could join in with easily, to make it inclusive and simple.
Vicky Stonebridges inspired idea has struck a note as far afield as the United States.
The hearts get fired twice and have to dry out before going into the kiln. The first batches have sold out within a few hours of them coming out of the kiln.
A TALENTED Wester Ross artist heartbroken by the unfolding humanitarian disaster in Ukraine was determined to do something to show her support for the relief effort.
I chose the Slava Ukraini slogan Glory to Ukraine as Ukrainians were banned from saying this during the Soviet era, and using this defiant slogan seems appropriate. Its been good to quietly come together with others to share our despair and helplessness in the face of this and all the other ongoing wars.
Vicky said: People have been very generous and I have been posting them across the UK and some even went to the US. All of the proceeds are going directly to the Red Cross, Disasters Emergency Committee  Ukrainian Humanitarian Appeal. The first day we raised 290, with more coming in every day.
