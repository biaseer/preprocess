The latest disruption comes as Russia presses on with its war campaign in Ukraine and ushers in a new era of energy instability. Russia was responsible for 40 of the EU's natural gas appetite in 2021, and one-third of that gas went through Ukraine.
Natural gas prices in Europe reversed earlier losses to surge as much as 8.1 on the news, before moderating.
The Russian natural gas could potentially be sent elsewhere although no clarification has been provided as to where an alternate entry point could be.
Ukraine's grid operator added that attempts were made to caution the Kremlin on the ramifications of the pro-Russian troop presence in Luhansk.
"The company repeatedly informed Gazprom about threats of transit due to the actions of the Russian-controlled occupation forces and demanded an end to interference in the operation of the facilities, but these appeals were ignored," itsaid.
The two essential entry points in Ukraine, Sokhranivka and Sudzha, are responsible for 27 and 73 of natural gas deliveries in the country, respectively.
Russian natural gas that flows through a key Ukrainian hub on its way to other parts of Europe will stop on Wednesday, said a grid operator, which blamed the Kremlin's occupying troops.
But on Tuesday, the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine said in a statement that shipments received via Sokhranivka will halt beginning at 7 am local time, according to Bloomberg.
