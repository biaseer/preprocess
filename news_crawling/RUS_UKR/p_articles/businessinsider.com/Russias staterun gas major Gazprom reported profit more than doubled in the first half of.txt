The company earned $41.75 billion, or 2.5 trillion rubles, from the start of 2022. That's up from about 968 billion rubles in the first half of 2021.
Gazprom has been accused of weaponizing energy through multiple interruptions to gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which went offline once again on Wednesday. The company has cited maintenance needs for each shutoff event, and the pipeline's flows had been reduced to 20 of capacity prior to the latest shutoff.
The company will also completely shutter natural gas flows to French utility major Engie on Thursday over a payment disagreement.
Meanwhile, Dutch TTF, the natural gas benchmark in Europe, is up more than 1,000 compared to a year ago as Gazprom has slashed deliveries and raised concerns about winter shortages.
Gazprom's record profits this year come as the West imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. While they largely steered clear of directly banning gas sales, Europe has scrambled to look for alternatives to Russian supplies.
Russia's state-run gas major Gazprom reported record net profit for the first half of the year on Tuesday, as elevated market prices continue to aid the Kremlin.
Gazprom is also considering paying investors a dividend after not doing so last year. Its board recommended paying 51.03 rubles per share, bringing the total payout to 1.208 trillion roubles.
