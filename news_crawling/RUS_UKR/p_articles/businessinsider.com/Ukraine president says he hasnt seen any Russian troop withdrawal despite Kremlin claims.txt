The US and UK had warned earlier this week that an invasion by Russia could happen in days.
Russia on Tuesday did not specify how many troops it was withdrawing, and other countries have been skeptical.
President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the US had not been able to verify Russia's claim that it was withdrawing some troops.
"The fact remains right now, Russia has more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine," he said. "An invasion remains distinctly possible."
He added that Russian troop withdrawal would be something that everyone would be able to see, not just the military. Russia's defense ministry on Tuesday published footage on Tuesday appearing to show military arsenal leaving the Ukrainian border.
Ukraine's president said on Wednesday he had not seen any withdrawal of Russian troops, despite Russia saying the day before that it was withdrawing some troops.
Volodymyr Zelensky told the BBC: "To be honest we react to the reality we have and we don't see any withdrawal yet. We just heard about it."
NATO's secretary general said on Wednesday that the body had not seen any evidence of Russian troop withdrawal  and that it actually looked like Russia was increasing its troop presence.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also tweeted on Tuesday:"We in Ukraine have a rule: we don't believe what we hear, we believe what we see."
