Psyuk said: Earlier this week, the entire Kalush Orchestra was together in Kyiv and witnessed a parade of Russian equipment on the Maidan, Kyivs main square, which our Armed Forces turned into a pile of scrap metal.
This years independence is also for all Ukrainians away from the front line, who are more united than ever and are also working tirelessly to speed up our victory together.
In June, the group delivered their first UK performance since they triumphed in Turin with a set on Shangri-Las Truth Stage at Glastonbury Festival.
Also, today we launched a collection of funds for the rehabilitation of fighters from Azovstal.
The facility became the last holdout of Ukrainian fighters and civilians during the fight for Mariupol, a city in the south east of the war-torn country.
On August 24, for 24 hours, we encourage our followers on social networks to donate 24 hryvnias each, all the funds will go to the rehabilitation of our military.
They later raised more than 700,000 for the Ukrainian army by auctioning off their crystal microphone trophy, and plan to tour the US from October with a portion of proceeds going to relief efforts at home.
Psyuk recently said they were grateful to the UK for showing solidarity with Ukraine by hosting Eurovision next year on its behalf.
Oleg Psyuk, leader of the Kalush Orchestra, urged fans to donate 24 hryvnias 55p or more towards the rehabilitation of those involved in the siege, which ended in May.
The folk-rap group have become international spokespeople for the Ukrainian war effort since sweeping to victory at Eurovision in May.
Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra have marked Ukrainian Independence Day by launching an appeal for the fighters who survived the battle for the Azovstal steelworks.
