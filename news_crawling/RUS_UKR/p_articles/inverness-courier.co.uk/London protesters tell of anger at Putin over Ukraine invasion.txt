Ukrainian protesters in London were emotional as they told of being angry about Russias invasion.
Some had tears in their eyes, while others were visibly angry as dozens of police officers watched on.
Helena Kovalenko, 33, originally from northern Ukraine, told the PA news agency: Im so angry with Putin for invading my Ukraine.
Ms Kovalenko, who has lived in the UK for nine years, added: Im here today to call for this country to help  Putin has to go.
The crowd, which blocked a path outside the embassy, shouted down with Putin and held posters comparing the Russian leader to Hitler.
Hundreds gathered outside the Russian embassy in Kensington and at Downing Street on Saturday afternoon to call for Vladimir Putin to withdraw from Ukraine.
Others used chalk to draw the Ukrainian flag on the embassys wall and flags were tied to the gate.
Waving flags, banners and placards, the protesters sang the Ukrainian anthem and chanted Putin stop war, Putin go home and free Ukraine.
