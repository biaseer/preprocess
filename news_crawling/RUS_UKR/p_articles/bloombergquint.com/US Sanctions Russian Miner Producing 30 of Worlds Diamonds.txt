Clients of Alrosa as well as other counterparties must stop all dealings with the state-controlled Russian miner by May 7, according to a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. The companys shares fell as much as 6.2 in Moscow trading. Alrosa declined to comment.
Last month, U.S.-based jewelers Tiffany  Co. and Signet Jewelers Ltd. said they were stopping buying new diamonds mined in Russia as pressure builds on companies to cut the nations products from their supply chains.
The U.S. restrictions tighten the screws on Alrosa as the risk of cross-sanctions threatens to deter buyers in other regions. The European Union and the U.K. previously imposed sanctions on the miner following Russias invasion of Ukraine. The main markets for Alrosa, which employs about 32,000 people, are the U.S. and Asia, including India.
Alrosa produces about the same amount of gems as De Beers, the iconic diamond company that had a monopoly until the start of this century. Russia vies with Botswana as the worlds biggest diamond producer, while the U.S. is the industrys most important market, accounting for about half of all sales.
Bloomberg -- The U.S. Treasury has extended sanctions to Russian diamond miner Alrosa PJSC, potentially cutting off about 30 of the worlds supply of rough stones.
