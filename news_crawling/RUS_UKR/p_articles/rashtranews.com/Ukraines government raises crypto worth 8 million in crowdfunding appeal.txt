Crypto donations to Ukrainian volunteer and hacking groups have also spiked since Russia launched its invasion on Thursday, Elliptic said this week.
Ukraines official Twitter account made the appeal for cryptocurrency donations on Saturday following the countrys invasion by Russia, posting digital wallets addresses for tokens including bitcoin and ether.
By 1030 GMT Sunday, the wallet addresses had received crypto worth $7.9 million across almost 11,500 donations, London-based Elliptic said. The company tracks the movement of digital coins on the blockchain, a public ledger that records crypto transactions.
The donations came as Russian military vehicles pushed into Ukraines second-largest city Kharkiv on Sunday and explosions rocked oil and gas installations on a fourth day of fighting in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.
Ukraines Vice-Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov Tweeted the wallet addresses. Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations, wrote Fedorov, who is also minister of digital transformation.

The donations to such groups, some of which have supplied equipment to government forces, grew strongly in January as Russia massed troops near Ukraines border ahead of its invasion.
