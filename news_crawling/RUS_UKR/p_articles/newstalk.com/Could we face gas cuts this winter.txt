The European Union has proposed a 15 in natural gas consumption over the course of the next eight months. The cut will affect households as well as power producers and could be made legally binding if Russia cuts its gas supply to Europe. Conor Minogue, IBEC's Senior executive with responsibility for infrastructure, energy and environmental policy, Paul Deane, Research professor at University College Cork and Ciaran Cuffe Green Party MEP for Dublin, do discuss what this winter could look like.
