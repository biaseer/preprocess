I agree with our flagpoles being used to protest world events, said Anderson, a reference to the city flying the Ukraine flag after the invasion of the country by Russia. I do not agree that they should be used for social issues. Were wading into territory we should not be in.
Vernon city hall will be a little more colourful outside for a week in August.
Im in full support. I have a family member who is involved in the 2SLGBTQIA, she said.
Vernon Pride, for the first time, will be bringing 2SLGBTQIA members together in Vernon to provide education resources, be a model of inclusiveness of all and welcome the great community of Vernon to join us in celebrating Vernon Pride Week, wrote the organizing committee.
Council voted by a margin of 5-1 to honour a request from Vernon Pride 2022 to raise the Pride Flag Monday, Aug. 8, at 1 p.m. and keep the flag flying for a week of planned celebrations until Aug. 14.

As Vernon Pride continues to build, we are looking forward to bringing more events to the community, said organizers.
