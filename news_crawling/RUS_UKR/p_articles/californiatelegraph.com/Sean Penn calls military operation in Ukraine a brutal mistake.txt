"It is already a brutal mistake of lives taken and hearts broken, and if he doesn't relent, I believe Russian president Mr. Vladimir Putin will have made a most horrible mistake for all of humankind. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people have risen as historic symbols of courage and principle. Ukraine is the tip of the spear for the democratic embrace of dreams. If we allow it to fight alone, our soul as America is lost," he said.
