Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced sanctions against eight Russian oligarchs close to Mr Putin yesterday, and earlier in the week travel bans and targeted financial sanctions were put on eight members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
"The Australian Government will continue to stand up for what is right when it comes to Ukraine," he said today after a vigil at St Andrews Ukrainian Church.
