The company said in a statement that it is "deeply concerned" about the Russian invasion and that in response, it has "paused all product sales" in the country.
"And we have disabled both traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps in Ukraine as a safety and precautionary measure for Ukrainian citizens."
"Last week, we stopped all exports into our sales channel in the country. Apple Pay and other services have been limited. RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from the App Store outside Russia," Apple said.
Following news of Apple's decision on Tuesday, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorovtweetedthat Apple CEO Tim Cook should "finish the job" and again urged the company to "block" access to its app store in Russia.
The Ukrainian government last week had asked Apple to stop offering its app store in Russia, but some security and democracy experts said that that could harm Russian users who are protesting the Kremlin and who rely on Western tools to organize.
Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all beguncracking down on contentshared by Russian media amid intensifying pressure from European officials to act against pro-Russian propaganda.
Apple's decision comes as tech companies have faced increasing public pressure to act against Russia.
Apple also said it has moved to limit access to digital services, such as Apple Pay, inside Russia, and restricted the availability of Russian state media applications outside the country.
