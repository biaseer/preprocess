The ship was forced to battle 6.5 metre waves with around 2000 passengers on board.
As the sun comes out, the clean up begins. Around half a dozen boats that have dragged anchor and run aground in the Broadwater will need to be towed out on high tide.
There was bedlam in the Broadwater with boats coming adrift, now upturned, and beached on the sand.
A Hazardous Surf Warning is also current for Fraser Island Coast, Sunshine Coast Waters and Gold Coast Waters.
The heavy rainfall that battered the coast on Friday eased across Saturday but damaging winds remained, bringing down trees and powerlines.
Passengers on the Coral Princess cruise ship currently circling off the coast of Brisbane have spent another night out at sea.
This means those passengers aboard the cruise ship are set to remain out at sea for some time yet.
Conditions are forecast to ease across the day but the Bureau of Meteorology still has a Severe Weather Warning in place for dangerous surf for people in parts of Wide Bay and Burnett and Southeast Coast Forecast Districts, forecasting dangerous surf along the exposed coastline south of Sandy Cape.
"These winds are still around for another day or so. We're expecting there are going to be some dramas but we have been lucky so far which has been very good," Glenn Norris from Volunteer Marine Rescue told 9News.
