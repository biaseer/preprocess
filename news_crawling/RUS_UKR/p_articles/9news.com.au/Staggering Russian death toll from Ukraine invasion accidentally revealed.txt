said last week it takes a five-to-one ratio for an invading army to take a city.
The damage wrought by bombing has created a nightmare defensive zone for the Russians to walk into.
If accurate, it means four times as many Russians have died in Ukraine in three weeks as US military personnel in Afghanistan in 20 years.
Meanwhile, Ukraine said on March 13 that 1300 of its soldiers have been killed. The Russians claimed it was more than double that figure.
Cities like Kyiv and Mariupol remain under relentless bombing and shelling, with many buildings destroyed and thousands of civilians killed.
The official death toll from the Russian Ministry of Defence is 498 troops, though it has been 20 days since that figure was updated.
That figure would make the invasion of Ukraine far bloodier than the ill-fated Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In that years-long conflict, about 15,000 Soviets died.
While it is difficult to determine accurate reports on the front line in Ukraine, it does appear Russia has made little progress in the past week.
Out of fuel and out of food, many Russian soldiers have left their tanks and trucks behind and walked away.
If the Russian army makes it into Kyiv, the number of soldiers killed will likely skyrocket.
While there is plenty of bad news for the Russian military, it does not mean good news for the Ukrainian people.
