's oldest woman has revealed the secret to a long life and it turns out it's not her fondness of champagne.
She was born in the Netherlands in 1912 and the centenarian has seen it all - living through two world wars and two pandemics
Van Der Linden is a great-grandmother to 15 and lives at Southern Cross Care's West Beach Residential in Adelaide but still remains fiercely independent.
Besides the occasional glass of champagne, Van Der Linden revealed the secret to living for more than a century which she claims is exercise.
"I'll celebrate with my family, a nice dinner somewhere. That is, for me, enough celebration," she said.
"I think except for the sister of my mother, there is no longevity in the family," she said.
She hits the gym twice a week at the residential care home and goes for two walks a day.
Catherina Van Der Linden will turn 110 on Friday, making her the oldest woman in the state.
"I try to do as much as I can by myself, that is my nature, I don't want to impose on other people," she said.
"Of course you have to care for your health. Everyone has to do that," she said.
For the big day on Friday, Van Der Linden wants to keep it low-key and spend it with family.
Van Der Linden married her husband John in 1940 and the pair emigrated to Australia a decade later.
