It comes as Russian troops have started to move in on the Ukrainian capital, tanks seen rolling through the northern districts.
The harrowing footage showed the tank swerving to drive over the car then reversing back over it in Kyiv's Obolon district.
Russia's military said it had seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv that allows it to quickly build up forces to take the capital.
Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said five explosions hit an area near a major power plant on the city's eastern outskirts.
He appeared to be alert in the video but the extent of his injuries are not known.
It claimed to have already cut the city off from the west  the direction many of those escaping the invasion are heading in, with lines of cars snaking toward the Polish border.
An elderly man had been driving the car and was rescued from the flattened car moments later.
