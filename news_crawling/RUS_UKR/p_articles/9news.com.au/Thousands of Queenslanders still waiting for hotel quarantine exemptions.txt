Health minister Yvette D'Ath said she understands people are under financial stress but said payment plans are available, adding the billing of hotel quarantine was a complex operation.
Juggling rising living costs on a single income, she said she doesn't know how she will pay the total if her application is denied.
Bengree, who has since had a baby says she is now unable to pay the fee.
Thousands of Queenslanders are still waiting for their hotel quarantine exemptions to be processed following lengthy delays from the Queensland government.
The young mum says she applied for a fee waiver but has heard nothing back from the government.
"And we don't think it's going to end yet if they don't get back to us," Bengree said.
The bill was supposed to arrive six to 10 weeks after the quarantine period but instead arrived five months later, in March this year.
Emily Bengree from Brisbane says she was well equipped to pay for her two week hotel quarantine during her stay in November but is now unable to do so.
Of the 77,000 people issued with hotel quarantine bills, 20,000 have asked for an exemption.
"That's not normally our core business to do that I think we've done it very well but we do appreciate there is a lag in getting those invoices out," D'Ath said.
Treasurer Cameron Dick said those facing financial hardships will be treated with compassion but those who can foot the bill will be required to pay.
"Then the recent floods affected us you know we had furniture covered in mould and with the baby we can't be having that problem," Bengree said.
