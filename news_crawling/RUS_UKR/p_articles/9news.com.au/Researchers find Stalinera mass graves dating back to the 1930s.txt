Mr Gutsalyuk said identifying the victims would not be possible because any records were held in Russia.
One of Ukraine's largest Stalin-era mass graves dating back to the late 1930s has been found by researchers.
Historians hundreds of thousands of people were killed during Joseph Stalin's repression of the 1930s and millions also died during a Stalin-era famine from 1932 to 1933.
Ukraine's National Memory Institute regional branch head Sergiy Gutsalyuk told AFP that the victims were likely to have been killed by the Soviet secret police unit.
The remains of up to 8000 people were found in 29 graves in the southern city of Oddessa.
