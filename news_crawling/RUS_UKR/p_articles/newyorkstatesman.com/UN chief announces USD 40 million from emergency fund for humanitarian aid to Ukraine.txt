New York US, March 14 ANI: United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Monday announced USD 40 million from the UN emergency fund for providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
On February 24, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics requested help in 'defending themselves'.
The Russian Defense Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only and the civilian population is not in danger.
Guterres added that the appeals for peace must be heard saying that it is never too late for diplomacy and dialogue.
The West, however, denies these claims by the Russians and in response, Western nations have imposed comprehensive sanctions on Moscow. In addition, they introduced sanctions on Belarus for supporting Russia's operation in Ukraine. ANI
