Boris Johnson has warned Russia that Britain will hit Moscow with sanctions the moment the first Russian toecap crosses further into Ukrainian territory.
But Mr Johnson was also forced to fend off questions about the scandal hanging over his leadership surrounding alleged lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street.
He added: It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy, and I believe that is still possible, we are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are, but we have the sanctions ready, were providing military support, and we will also intensify our economic cooperation.
We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues. The ability to comment on our stories is a privilege, not a right, however, and that privilege may be withdrawn if it is abused or misused.
During a diplomatic mission to Kyiv, the Prime Minister said it is vital the Kremlin steps back from what would be a military disaster for both Russia and the world.
At a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Prime Minister said: We have done all this and prepared all this not as a show of hostility towards Russia, but as a demonstration that we will always stand up for freedom and democracy and Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of aggression.
