Myanmar was also working together with China to develop major energy projects including the 1,390-MW Mee Lin Gyaing LNG power project, it said.
YANGON, April 21 Xinhua -- Myanmar has been working to accelerate development of hydrocarbon and renewable energy for domestic power supply, the Ministry of Information and Ministry of Investment and Foreign Economic Relations said in a joint statement on Thursday.
According to the statement, the country's State Administration Council would step up repair of damaged power infrastructure for better power supply in the country.
The Southeast Asian country was increasing investments in renewable energy sectors after developing solar power projects including the 40-MW Letpanhla and 30-MW Nyaungbingyi solar projects, it added.
The country would increase power generation in the country from oil and gas sources through new investments, partnerships and actions such as conversion to the use of existing facilities, the statement said.
It added that China, Myanmar's largest neighbor and major economic partner, would play an increasingly important role in the country's energy-related developments.
It also said the recent temporary shortage of power was caused by a surge of global liquefied natural gas LNG prices, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a weaker kyat currency.
