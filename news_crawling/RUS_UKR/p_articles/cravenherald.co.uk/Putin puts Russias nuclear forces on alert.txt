White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr Putin is resorting to a pattern he used in the weeks before launching the invasion, which is to manufacture threats that dont exist in order to justify further aggression.

Amid the mounting tensions, Ukraine announced that a delegation would meet with Russian officials for talks.
Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes.
Unload your weapons, raise your hands so that our servicemen and civilians can understand that you have heard us. This is your ticket home, Lt Gen Moisiuk said in a Facebook video.

But the Kremlins ultimate intentions towards Ukraine  and what steps might be enough to satisfy Moscow  remained unclear.
Russia has taken the path of evil, and the world should come to depriving it of its UN Security Council seat, he said.
