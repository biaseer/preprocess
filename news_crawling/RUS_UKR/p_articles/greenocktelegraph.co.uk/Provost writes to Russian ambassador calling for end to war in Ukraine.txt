We call on the Federation of Russia to cease its attacks, to leave the national territory of Ukraine, to respect all international treaties and fundamental principles of international law and to recognise the full sovereignty of Ukraine over all its territories.
We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues. The ability to comment on our stories is a privilege, not a right, however, and that privilege may be withdrawn if it is abused or misused.
INVERCLYDE'S Provost Martin Brennan has written to the Russian ambassador calling for an end to his country's war in Ukraine.
Provost Brennan said: "In Inverclyde we have been both shocked and saddened by the tragic scenes that are now being shown around the world, and the council wishes to express its full support and solidarity to the Ukrainian people.
