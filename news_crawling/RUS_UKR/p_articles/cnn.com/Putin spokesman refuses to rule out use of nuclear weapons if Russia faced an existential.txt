The United States condemned Peskovs dangerous comments. Its not the way a responsible nuclear power should act, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday.
In an interview with CNNs Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov repeatedly refused to rule out that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons against what Moscow saw as an existential threat. When asked under what conditions Putin would use Russias nuclear capability, Peskov replied, if it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be.
Putin has previously hinted at using nuclear weapons against nations that he saw as a threat to Russia. Back in February, the Russian President said in a televised statement, No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.
He also claimed that Russia has only attacked military targets, despite numerous reports of Russian airstrikes against civilian targets sheltering ordinary Ukrainians.
The interview comes as Western intelligence has reported that Russias operations have stalled in parts of Ukraine.
Peskov also repeated Putins demands, saying that the main goals of the operation are to get rid of the military potential of Ukraine, to ensure Ukraine is a neutral country, to get rid of nationalist battalions, for Ukraine to accept that Crimea  annexed by Russia in 2014  is part of Russia and to accept that the breakaway statelets of Luhansk and Donetsk are already independent states.
When asked what Putin thought he had achieved in Ukraine so far, Peskov answered: Well, first of all, not yet. He hasnt achieved yet.
He then said in a televised meeting with Russian defense officials that officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert.
The spokesman also claimed that the special military operation  the Kremlins official euphemism for Russias invasion in Ukraine  was going on strictly in accordance with the plans and the purposes that were established before hand.
Ukraine has denied Russia a victory for four weeks. A grim new phase could be coming
Russian President Vladimir Putins chief spokesman has conceded that Russia has yet to achieve any of its military goals in Ukraine and refused to deny that Moscow could resort to the use of nuclear weapons.
