Wizz Air said it would suspend all flights to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine on 27th February, despite a previous statement saying that its Abu Dhabi to Moscow flights would resume in October.
In a statement, the European budget carrier referred only to "industry supply chain limitations," but did not mention the social media backlash, which included calls for a boycott against theairline.
On Twitter, the airline responded to criticism by noting that the flight would be run by its venture in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, which is a registered carrier in the Gulf state, adding that other Emirati airlines are currently flying to Russia.
ABU DHABI, UAE: After mounting criticism, Wizz Air has suspended its plans to reinstate flights from Moscow to Abu Dhabi this month.
The UAE said it would maintain a neutral stance and has not imposed sanctions on Russia.
As part of Western sanctions against Moscow, European carriers have ceased operations with Russia, while Russian airlines are banned from European Union airspace.
Wizz Air, which is listed in London, holds a 49 percent stake in Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, which uses the European airline's name and branding and is 51 percent owned by the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, ADQ.
