Today though Russias deputy defense minister said that Moscow would fundamentally cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernigiv in order to increase mutual trust for future negotiations to agree and sign a peace deal with Ukraine.
If you follow reports closely, youve heard that the Ukrainian military has incrementally been reclaiming territory from Russian forces in the north of the country and parts of the south in recent days. The situation is different in the east and southeast, in parts of which Russia has continued to consolidate its possession of territory. There have also been reports of Russian withdrawals. But its been hard to disentangle which of these withdrawals are more like retreats in the face of counter-offensives, or simply redeployments to find more defensible positions, or actual withdrawals. All thats been clear is that in substantial parts of the country Ukraine has been retaking control of territory that had been occupied by the Russian Army.
