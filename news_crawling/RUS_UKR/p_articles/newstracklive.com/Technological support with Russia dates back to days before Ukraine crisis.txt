TEHRAN:The Iran Foreign Ministry has said that the technological cooperation between Russia and Iran dates back to the days before the Ukrainian crisis. The comments were made by Nasser Kanaani, the ministry's spokesman, in response to a question regarding Jake Sullivan's assertion that Iran is getting ready to give Russia hundreds of drones, including ones that can fire weapons, as per the Xinhua report.
In addition, Kanaani charged that the US and EU have turned nations, especially several in West Asia, into "an arsenal of their numerous destructive armaments."
Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly gave the military orders to "retake occupied coastal areas that are essential to the country's economy," Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said earlier.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian mentioned recently that the NATO military alliance's expansion into Russia's frontiers and its provocations against Moscow are to blame for the Ukrainian conflict. The minister stated that diplomacy and negotiation should be used to address the conflict in Ukraine. Iran's stance on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which broke out in February, is absolutely clear and has been declared time and again officially", he noted.
He said Iran's position on the Russian-Ukrainian war, which started in late February, is "very obvious and has been formally proclaimed time and time again."
