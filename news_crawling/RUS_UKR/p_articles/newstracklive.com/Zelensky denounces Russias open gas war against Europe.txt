Kyiv: Ukrain PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky denounced Russia's overt gas war against Europe and urged them to strengthen sanctions against Moscow. "Russia will not resume supplying gas to European nations as required by contract, despite the compromise over the Nord Stream turbine. Russia has purposefully done all of this to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to be ready for the winter "During his nightly address, Zelensky said.
It is important to note that Europe depends substantially on Russian energy supplies. Following ten days of maintenance, Russia this week resumed essential gas shipments to Europe via Germany via Nord Stream, but only at 40 of the pipeline's capacity.
"New gas-related concerns to Europe surfaced today... Russia is launching an open gas war against an unified Europe "In response to Gazprom's announcement of a further reduction in gas deliveries to Europe, Zelenskyy said. Furthermore, in retaliation for the sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the West had accused Moscow of using energy as a weapon. he said.
In the meantime, Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom announced to slash daily gas deliveries to Europe through the Nord Stream pipeline to 33 million cubic metres a day from Wednesday.
Zelensky continued by saying that Moscow's most recent action was a part of a larger series of what he called "forms of terror." They don't care how the people suffer, whether it is from starvation brought on by the closure of the ports, from the cold and poverty of the winter, or from occupation, Zelensky said, adding that these are simply many manifestations of terror.
Russia is launching an open chemical war against an unified Europe, and this is exactly how it should be seen, he said.
