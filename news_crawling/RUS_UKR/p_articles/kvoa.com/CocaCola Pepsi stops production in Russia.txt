In recent days, the brands have drawn criticism for operating in Russia while other U.S. companies announced suspensions.
Coca-Cola and Pepsico both announced today that they would be boycotting the country for the invasion of Ukraine.
And it's one of the few regions worldwide where Coke's rival Pepsico has a larger presence.
