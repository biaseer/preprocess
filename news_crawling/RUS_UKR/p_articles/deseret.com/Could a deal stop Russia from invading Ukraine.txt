Whats happening: French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he thinks a deal could happen between Ukraine and Russia soon, which would stop a full-scale war from breaking out, BBC News reports.
Ukraine and Russia could possibly sign a deal that would stop an invasion and potentially ease tension between Russia and the West.
The bigger picture: Russia has currently enough military troops to seize any city in Ukraine, the countrys former defense minister said, according to Business Insider.
State of play: Tension has been building between Russia and the West since Russia set up military camps and equipment on the border of Ukraine.
What he said: We must protect our European brothers by proposing a new balance capable of preserving their sovereignty and peace, Macron said.
