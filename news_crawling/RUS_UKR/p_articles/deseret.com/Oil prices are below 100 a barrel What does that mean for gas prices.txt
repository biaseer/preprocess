Why did oil prices drop? Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader for CIBC Private Wealth U.S., said that the price drop was due to a mix of geopolitical and demand factors, according to CNBC.
How do oil prices affect gas prices? As stated in previous reporting, gas prices are affected by a wide range of factors, but largely influenced by oil prices.
Due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, gas prices were at their highest in almost 15 years during the first week of March.
What does this mean for gas prices? Even though the national average gas prices are at a record high, the prices have stopped going up, according to AAA.
On March 7, Brent crude oil, the world benchmark for crude oil, hit a high of $139.13, and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, hit a high of $130.50, according to Reuters.
Since then, oil prices have taken a drop. On Monday, Brent crude oil fell 8 to $103.68, and WTI fell 8.75 to $99.76, per CNBC.
What can we expect in the future? Experts are predicting that gas prices will rise again once demand recovers.
