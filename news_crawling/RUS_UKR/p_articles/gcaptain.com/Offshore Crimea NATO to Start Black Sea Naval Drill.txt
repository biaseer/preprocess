Relations between Kyiv and Moscow plummeted after Russia seized Crimea and over Russias support for a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine.
Tension rose again this year when Russia massed troops on the border with Ukraine, where some of them remain along with their equipment.
Ukraine says the main goal is to gain experience in joint actions during multinational peacekeeping and security operations.
Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and says it is Russian territory, but the peninsula is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.
By Pavel Polityuk Reuters  Ukraine and the United States will start a military exercise involving more than 30 countries in the Black Sea and southern Ukraine on Monday, despite Russian calls to cancel the drills. Sea Breeze 2021 follows a rise in tensions between NATO and Moscow, which said last week it had fired warning shots and dropped bombs in the path of a British warshipto chase it out of Black Sea waters off the coast of Crimea. Britain rejected Russias account of the incident.
Russias embassy in Washington called last week for the drills to be canceled, and the Russian defense ministry said it would react if necessary to protect its own national security.
