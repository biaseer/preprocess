How much and what types of cargo will be impacted was not immediately clear. While it has been widely reported that there are no Russian-flagged ships in currently in U.S. waters, but as announced the refusal applies to any Russian cargo.
With this action in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, we send a strong message that we unequivocally condemn the Russian invasion, said ILWU International President Willie Adams.
U.S. West Coast dockworkers will refuse to work any Russian cargo in solidarity with Ukraine.
The International Longshore and Warehouse Unions Coast Longshore Division made the announcement on Twitter on Thursday. The union represents over 22,000 longshore workers at 29 ports on the U.S. West Coast from San Diego, California to Bellingham, Washington. Its members are responsible for moving over 16 million of containers annually as of 2019, as well as bulk cargo and in some cases tankers.
The action is effective immediately and applies to any Russian cargo coming into or going out.
West Coast dockworkers are proud to do our part to join with those around the world who are bravely taking a stand and making sacrifices for the good of Ukraine, Adams added.
