Russian military moves are being closely watched by the West at a time when a troop build-up near its border with Ukraine has sparked fears of a conflict. Moscow has denied it plans to launch an attack on Ukraine.
Wednesdays drills in the Arctic, which involve around 30 warships, 20 aircraft and 1,200 personnel, are designed to assess troops combat readiness in the Arctic and their ability to protect the Northern Sea Route.
Moscow said last week it would stage a series of drills involving all its fleets in the seas directly adjacent to Russia. The exercises will also include maneuvers in the Mediterranean, the North Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific.
