Sal Mercogliano, host of Whats Going on With Shipping, is joined by the CEO of gCaptain, John Konrad, to discuss the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Global Shipping. The discussion then focuses on the current situation in Ukraine and the Black Sea, along with the shut down of ports in Ukraine, the closing of the Kerch Strait, and an attack on a Turkish cargo ship. They ask if the US Navy or NATO is prepared to protect commercial shipping in the Balck Sea? Both Sal and John explore the implications of war and the impact of this invasion on shipping and its different sectors, including bulk, energy, and containers.
