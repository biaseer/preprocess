Gov. Eric Holcomb Monday condemned Russias invasion of Ukraine and, in his words, the tyranny of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
The Indiana House adopted language last week that would bar Russian businesses from buying land in the state for one year. But Republicans blocked an amendment that wouldve directed state government to divest from Russian-controlled companies.
That statement came with an executive order that takes few concrete steps to sever Indianas ties with Russia.

Holcomb said Indiana will standby to assist with Ukrainian refugees if the U.S. takes them in.
But beyond that, no actual action  at a time when other states are actively cutting off investments and ties to Russia.
Indiana will review state contracts with Russian-owned and affiliated businesses. It will evaluate investments into state retirement accounts involving the Russian ruble or Russian companies. And it will ask state universities to report Russian funding.
