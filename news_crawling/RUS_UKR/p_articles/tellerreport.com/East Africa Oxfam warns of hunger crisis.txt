The organization calls on "governments, particularly in grain-exporting countries, to do everything in their power to find suitable alternatives to Ukraine's supplies to low-income countries dependent on food imports."
According to Oxfam, 21 million people in East African countries are already suffering from severe hunger.
Up to 28 million people across East Africa are at risk of starvation if the rains fail to materialize in March.
East African countries import up to 90 percent of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia.
"The effects of the Ukraine conflict on the global food system will be felt around the globe, but it is the poorest and most vulnerable people who will be hit the hardest and fastest," said Bucher.
Even if the rains start to fall this month, the situation will not calm down completely," says Bucher.
With the international community's attention focused on Ukraine, there is a risk that it will not respond adequately to the escalating hunger crisis in East Africa.
The Russian war of aggression in Ukraine has catastrophic consequences in East Africa as well. The region imports 90 percent of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia. According to Oxfam, 21 million people are already struggling with severe hunger.
The reason for this is, among other things, the war in Ukraine, said CEO Gabriela Bucher.
