This is unacceptable, given the historical experience of Germany in matters of mass reprisals against people and the spread of misanthropic ideology, RIA Novosti quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying.
Earlier, Scholz, during his speech at the Munich Security Conference, called the statements about the genocide of the population in Donbass ridiculous.
In turn, the official representative of the State Department, Ned Price, expressed the opinion that the statements about the genocide in the Donbass are devoid of any grounds.
Russian Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov said that statements by US officials questioning the fact of the genocide in Donbass are a manifestation of cynicism and double standards.
The words of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about the denial of the genocide in Donbass are unacceptable. This was stated in the press service of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
Earlier, Putin said that, according to the Russian side, what is happening now in the Donbass is genocide.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that "it is not for German leaders to laugh at the issues of genocide."
