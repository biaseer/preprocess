We cannot prevent Russia from selling oil to other countries, we do not have such capabilities, but we are Russia's main clients.
Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said that Moscow would find other oil importers after the EU decision on a partial ban on Russian oil imports.
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell acknowledged that the European Union will not be able to prevent Russia from selling oil to third countries.
Earlier it became known that the leaders of the EU countries agreed on a partial ban on the import of Russian oil.
Borrell noted that the purpose of Western sanctions is "deprivation of funding for the Russian army."
At the same time, it is noted that the European Union embargo on oil imports from Russia will not apply to pipeline deliveries.
