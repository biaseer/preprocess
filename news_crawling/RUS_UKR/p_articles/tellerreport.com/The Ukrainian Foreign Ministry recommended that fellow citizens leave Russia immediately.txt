The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine recommended that its citizens immediately leave the territory of Russia in connection with the "intensification of Russian aggression."
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that citizens of Ukraine refrain from any trips to the Russian Federation, and those who are in this country should immediately leave its territory, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Earlier, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba announced his support for the idea of breaking off diplomatic relations with Russia.
Failure to follow these recommendations "would make it much more difficult to provide adequate protection to Ukrainian citizens," Kiev added.
Deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Andrei Rudenko said that Russia does not want to break off diplomatic relations with Ukraine.
