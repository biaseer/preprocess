The war games follow U.S. President Joe Bidens warning on Thursday that Russia could invade Ukraine within days.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will personally oversee Saturdays exercise, which will involve multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, the Defense Ministry said.
The Black Sea Fleet has surface warships and submarines equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, but its doesnt have intercontinental ballistic missiles and didnt take part in similar previous drills of the countrys strategic forces.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin would observe the drills from the Defense Ministrys situation room and supervise the practice missile launches himself.
Moscow argued that the pullback takes time and rejected Western criticism, saying that it would deploy troops wherever its necessary to ensure national security.
Russia holds massive drills of its strategic nuclear forces on an annual basis, but the maneuvers planned for Saturday pointedly involve the Black Sea Fleet. The fleet is based on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
Western fears focus on an estimated 150,000 Russian troops  including about 60 of Russias overall ground forces  concentrated near Ukraines borders. The Kremlin insists it has no plans to invade.
The Russian military said it started pulling troops back to their permanent bases after the drill. The U.S. and its allies questioned the claim and said that Moscow has actually moved thousands of new troops closer to Ukraine.
The strategic forces of both Russia and the United States include a nuclear triad of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-based ICBMs and nuclear-capable bombers.
The Kremlins Peskov said Russia notified foreign partners in advance and the exercise shouldnt cause worries in the West.
Practice launches of ballistic missiles are part of regular training, he said. They are preceded by a series of notices to other nations via different channels.
MOSCOW AP  The Russian military on Friday announced massive drills of its strategic nuclear forces, a stark reminder of the countrys nuclear might amid Western fears that Moscow might be preparing to invade Ukraine.
The exercise of Russias nuclear forces follows a series of sweeping drills that the Russian military held near Ukraine and in Belarus, an ally of Moscow that neighbors Ukraine to the north.
But Moscow has demanded that the U.S. and its allies keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of NATO, not deploy weapons in Ukraine and pull back NATO forces from Eastern Europe.
Washington and its allies bluntly rejected the Russian demands, and Moscow threatened to take unspecified military-technical measures if the West continued to stonewall.
The ministry said it planned the maneuvers some time ago to check the readiness of Russias military command and personnel, as well as the reliability of its nuclear and conventional weapons.
