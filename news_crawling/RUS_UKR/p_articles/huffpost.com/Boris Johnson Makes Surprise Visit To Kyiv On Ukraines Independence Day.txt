U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Ukraines independence day.
The Telegraph reported that U.K. diplomats have been travelling to European capitals to make the case against cutting aid to Kyiv.
Zelenskyy has vowed to fight against Vladimir Putins invasion until the end and pledged he would not make any concession or compromise to end the conflict.
We dont care what army you have, we only care about our land. We will fight for it until the end, Zelenskyy said in a video address on Wednesday.
The history of Ukraine's independence is quite dramatic and inspiring. Ukrainian nation was fighting for centuries and continues to do so since Feb 24. Devotion, bravery, freedom. Our land - our independence. Brief historic update by United24media: https:t.col66r5QYI6B. pic.twitter.comW68zn4wvtB
The British prime minister shared a photograph of himself alongside President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and tweeted: What happens in Ukraine matters to us all.
Johnsons visit comes amid concerns that European support for Ukraines battle against Russia could dry up amid the cost of living crisis.
That is why I am in Kyiv today. That is why the UK will continue to stand with our Ukrainian friends.
