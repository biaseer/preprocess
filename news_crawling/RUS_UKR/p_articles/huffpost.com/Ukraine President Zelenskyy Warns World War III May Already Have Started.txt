The war, and the possible use of nuclear weapons, means civilization is at stake, he added.
Zelenskyy said Ukrainians would remain defiant, though, even if their capital Kyiv was taken by Russian troops.
Our people are unconquerable, he said. You can conquer the city, break the heart, but you wont be able to force anybody to love someone. That is why the heart will always remain with Ukrainians.
They have killed over 100 children and I dont understand the meaning of red lines. What else should we wait for? Letting Russians kill 200 or 300 or 400 children? he asked.
Nobody knows whether it may have already started, the Ukrainian leader told NBC News Lester Holt. And what is the possibility of this war if Ukraine will fall, in case Ukraine will fall? Its very hard to say.
Russia, with its invasion of Ukraine, crossed all the red lines when they started shelling civilians, Zelenskyy said in the interview, which aired following his address to Congress.
