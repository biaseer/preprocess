Ukraine has passed a law offering up to $1 million to Russian defectors who bring with them a fighter jet or warship.
Measure 7229 also promises up to $500,000 for helicopters, $100,000 for tanks, and $10,000 for other types of military vehicles, according to the website for Ukraines parliament, the Verkhovna Rada.
A kind of shopping list from the government was posted on Twitter by Euan MacDonald, an editor-at-large for The New Voice of Ukraine.
Smaller amounts would be meted out to defectors with other sought-after equipment. Ukraine leaders aim to use the law  and the money  to capitalize on the widely reported low morale of Russian troops.
Besides money, defectors giving up Russian equipment are offered secrecy, a safe stay in Ukraine and support in obtaining new documents and an exit for a third country.
Oleksandr Kornienko, first vice speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said in a statement that the money will be an additional incentive for the demoralized occupiers to lay down their arms.
The Ukrainian parliament has approved a law with a list of rewards for Russian military equipment. Russian soldiers defecting to Ukraine with a warship or a jet can now claim up to $1 million. A tank or an artillery piece would be worth a $100,000 reward.
