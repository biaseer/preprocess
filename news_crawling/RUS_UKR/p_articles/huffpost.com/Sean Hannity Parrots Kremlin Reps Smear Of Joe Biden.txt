Hannity flashed Peskovs words on screen, quoted them, then immediately segued into his own attack on Biden as weak.
Given such irritability from Mr. Biden, his fatigue and sometimes forgetfulness ... fatigue that leads to aggressive statements, we will not make harsh assessments, so as not to cause more aggression, Peskov arrogantly added.
Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday sympathetically quoted word for word a personal attack on Joe Biden by one of Vladimir Putins henchmen as a springboard for his own dig at the presidents weakness. See the clip below.
The Fox-Kremlin lovefest came full circle Friday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised Fox News for its pro-Russia coverage of the Ukraine invasion.
Like Ive been saying, Bidens weakness on the world stage is emboldening bad actors all across the globe, Hannity said.
We hear and see statements that are actually personal insults to President Putin, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier in the day, after Biden called Putin a war criminal for bombing children in the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
We know the manners and the tricks that are being used by the Western countries to manipulate media, said Lavrov. If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative point of view, he added, apparently referring to the Kremlin point of view.
