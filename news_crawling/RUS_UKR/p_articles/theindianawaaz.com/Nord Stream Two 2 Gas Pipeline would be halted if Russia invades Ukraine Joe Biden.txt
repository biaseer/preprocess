US President Joe Biden said that the Nord Stream Two 2 Gas Pipeline would be halted if Russia invades Ukraine. This comes in the backdrop of Russia amassing close to 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border. Nord Stream Two 2 is an ambitious project having 750-miles of gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany.
The Baltic Sea pipeline bypasses Ukraine and is seen as depriving Kyiv of lucrative transit fees. The pipeline has been completed but has not yet been certified by Germanys energy regulator. Eventhough Germany has delayed the approval of the Nord Stream Two 2 Pipeline, it has refused to cancel the project. EU officials fear any move against Nord Stream 2 would trigger retaliation from Moscow, which provides for a major part of their gas demands.
