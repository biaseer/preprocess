Kharkiv, the Ukraines second-largest city, faced increased Russian shelling Tuesday, while a column of Russian forces stretched out along a road north of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on the sixth day of Russias invasion of its neighbor.
Ukraine also reported Tuesday that troops from Russian ally Belarus had entered Ukraines Chernihiv region.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described Russias missile attack on Kharkivs main square Tuesday as frank, undisguised terror as well as a war crime. Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation.
The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry shared a video of one strike at the Kharkiv Regional State Administration building in the center of the city that created a huge ball of fire and smoke as several cars passed through.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed allegations of war crimes and told reporters that Russian troops dont conduct any strikes against civilian infrastructure and residential areas, despite evidence of Kremlin attacks on homes, schools and hospitals, which reporters for The Associated Press have documented.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday that Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure that took place Monday in Kharkiv violates the laws of war.
An emergency services official said the strike killed at least six people and injured 20 others.
