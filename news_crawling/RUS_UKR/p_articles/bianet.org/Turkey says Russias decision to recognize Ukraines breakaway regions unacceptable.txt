"We reiterate once again our commitment to the preservation of Ukraine's political unity and territorial integrity and invite all concerned parties to act with common sense and to abide by international law," it said.
"The decision of the Russian Federation to recognize the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk Republics, in addition to contradicting the Minsk Agreements, constitutes a clear violation of Ukraine's political unity and territorial integrity," the ministry said in a statement yesterday February 21.
Western countries have accused Russia of amassing more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine, prompting fears that it could be planning a military offensive against its former Soviet neighbor.
Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that Russia's decision to recognize Ukraine's breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, calling it "unacceptable."
The move came after Russian President Vladimir Putin officially recognized Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent states Monday and signed agreements with their separatist leaders in the Kremlin.
Moscow has repeatedly denied any plan to invade Ukraine and instead accused Western countries of undermining Russia's security through NATO's expansion toward its borders. VK
