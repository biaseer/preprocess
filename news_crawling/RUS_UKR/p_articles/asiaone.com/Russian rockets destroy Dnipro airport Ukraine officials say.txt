Russian forces fired rockets into Ukraine's Luhansk and Dnipro regions on Sunday April 10, Ukrainian officials said, completely destroying an airport and wounding at least five people.
Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the central Dnipropetrovsk region, said emergency workers were combing through an infrastructure facility that was hit in the town of Zvonetsky, adding that details on casualties would be given later.
"The airport itself was destroyed, as well as nearby infrastructure. And the rockets fly and fly," Reznichenko said.
Separately, the head of the Dnipro region council, Mykola Lukashuk, says five staffers of the state emergency service had been wounded by the strike on the airport.
"Overnight high-precision missiles destroyed the base and headquarters of the nationalist Dnepr battalion in Zvonetsky, which also recently received reinforcements from foreign mercenaries," Russia's Defence Ministry said.
Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, an eastern region bordering Russia, wrote earlier on Telegram that a school and a high-rise apartment building had been hit in the city of Sievierodonetsk.
Reznichenko said earlier that an attack on Dnipro had wounded one person and the rockets had sparked a fire that was eventually put out. A missile had also hit a building in the Pavlograd district, he added.
Reznichenko said on Telegram that there had also been an attack on the airport in Dnipro city.
