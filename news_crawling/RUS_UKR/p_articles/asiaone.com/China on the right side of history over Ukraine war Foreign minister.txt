Wang's comments came after US President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart,Xi Jinping, on Friday of "consequences" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war," Wang said, reiterating that China will make independent judgements.
"China's position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China's claims are on the right side of history."
While saying it recognises Ukraine's sovereignty, Beijing has repeatedly said that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
Wang said the most important message Xi sent was that China has always been a force for maintaining world peace.
During the video call, Xi toldBiden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on Nato nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing's statements about the call.
"China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicions against China,"Wang told reporters on Saturday March 19 evening, according to a statement published by his ministry on Sunday.
The United States and its European and Asian allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for the Feb 24 invasion of its neighbour, which they call a war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin.
SHANGHAI- China stands on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis as time will tell, and its position is in line with the wishes of most countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.
