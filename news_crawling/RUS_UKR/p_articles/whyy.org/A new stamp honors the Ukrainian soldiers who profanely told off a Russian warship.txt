Ukraine introduced the design for a new postage stamp that memorializes a now-famous battle cry rallying the country in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Diplomats from Ukraines allies sought to win over more nations that have been ambivalent toward the war, including China.
According to an interpreter for NPR, the artist of the winning design, Borys Grokh, told Ukrposhta he was so impressed by the soldiers refusal to surrender that he decided to submit an illustration to lift morale.
Grokh used to live in a city on the Crimean peninsula, just east of Snake Island. He is now in Lviv, in western Ukraine.
The first lady appealed for more countries to join in, saying we cannot be the only ones helping.
The soldiers had been stationed on the island, which is in the Black Sea south of Ukraines mainland, and used the choice words when Russian naval forces told them to surrender.
An interpreter for NPR says the famous phrase quite literally translates to English as an expression that doesnt quite exist in English.
The treaty will create a new body to manage ocean life conservation and establish marine protected areas in ocean regions outside national boundary waters.
It took him three days to complete the sketch and, if he hadnt been distracted by the news, he could have created it in five hours, he told the postal service.
The Ukrainian Postal Service Ukrposhta announced the stamp design after holding a public vote on social media for a postage stamp competition meant to commemorate the soldiers who defended a military outpost on the island last month.
The stamp  called Russian warship, go f yourself!  references an interaction on Snake Island.
