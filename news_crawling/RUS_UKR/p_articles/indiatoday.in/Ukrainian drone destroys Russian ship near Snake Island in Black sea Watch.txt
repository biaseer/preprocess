Last month, Ukraine said that it had achieved a major victory as one of Russia's most important and potent warships suffered massive damage after a missile attack. Ukraine said two Neptune anti-ship missiles were fired to target the leading Russian Slava-class Moskva warship.
In another tweet, the Ukrainian military also claimed that two anti-aircraft missile systems, "Tor" were hit by the Bayraktar TB2 national strike fleet.
By India Today Web Desk: Kyiv on Saturday said that it had destroyed another Russian ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea. An armed drone had destroyed a Serna project landing craft and a missile defence system on the small island under Russian control.
