By India Today Web Desk: Ukrainian authorities on Monday claimed that the Russian strikes on the railway infrastructure killed five and injured 18 in Central Ukraine.
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine now enters its third month, Moscow has increased its offensive in eastern Ukraine in order to capture the Donbas region. Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 21 declared that Ukraine's Mariupol had been 'successfully liberated'. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has appealed to partners to supply more arms. He said, If we had access to all the weapons we need which our partners have, we would have already ended this war. It is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing for years.
In an earlier incident, a Russian fuel depot close to the Ukraine border had caught fire. The oil storage in the city of Bryansk had gone up in flames early on Monday, April 25.
