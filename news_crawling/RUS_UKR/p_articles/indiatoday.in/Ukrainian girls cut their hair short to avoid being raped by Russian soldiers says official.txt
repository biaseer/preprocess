In the Ukrainian town of Ivankiv, about 50 miles away from the capital Kyiv, young girls cut their hair short to be less attractive and avoid getting raped by occupying Russian soldiers, according to deputy mayor Maryna Beschastna.
During the period of occupation, women were pulled out of basements by their hair so Russian soldiers could abused them, deputy mayor Maryna Beschastna said. "Girls started cutting their hair short to be less attractive, so no one looks at them anymore, she said.
In one instance, a Ukrainian woman said she was raped by Russian soldiers moments after her husband was shot dead, while her terrified four-year-old son was crying in the next room.
Speaking to ITV News, she described one incident in which two sisters  15 and 16 years of age  were allegedly raped in a village nearby.
The town was liberated on March 30 after more than a month of being occupied by Russian forces.
Ivankiv is not the only part of Ukraine from where reports of rape have emerged.
Additionally, Ukrainian Member of Parliament Lesia Vasylenk has claimed that Russian soldiers raped girls as young as 10 years old and branded women's bodies.
