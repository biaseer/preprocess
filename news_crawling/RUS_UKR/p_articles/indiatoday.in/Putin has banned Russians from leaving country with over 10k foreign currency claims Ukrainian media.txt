By India Today Web Desk: Facing numerous financial and other sanctions from several countries and organisations, Russia is now trying to take stringent countermeasures. According to Ukrainian media outlet The Kyiv Independent, Russian President Vladimir Putin has now signed a decree prohibiting Russians from leaving the country with more than USD 10,000 in foreign currency.
"Putin's actions in Ukraine were premeditated and unprovoked... We are ready and we are united. Putin is now isolated from the world," he added.
The Ukrainians are fighting with pure courage, but the next few days, weeks, and months are going to be tough for them. Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks but he'll never gain the hearts  souls of the Ukrainian people, and he will never weaken the resolve of the free world, Biden said.
The move follows the sanctions the US, its allies, the EU, and other nations have imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
