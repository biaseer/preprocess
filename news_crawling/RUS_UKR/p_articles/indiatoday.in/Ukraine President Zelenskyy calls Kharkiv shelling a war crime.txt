"The strike against Kharkiv is a war crime. Kharkiv and Kyiv are now Russia's most important objectives. They advance on the capital in the same way as on Kharkiv. This is why the defence of the capital is a key priority for the state," Zelenskyy said in a video statement.
By India Today Web Desk: Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the Russian shelling in Kharkiv as a war crime and said defending the capital city of Kyiv from Russian troops was a top priority.
With profound sorrow we confirm that an Indian student lost his life in shelling in Kharkiv this morning. The Ministry is in touch with his family. We convey our deepest condolences to the family, the MEA said in a statement.
For the first time since Adolf Hitler initiated World War II, the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Kyiv are being bombed. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 and has been launching strikes across the country for almost a week now.
On Tuesday, the government headquarters in Kharkiv suffered significant damage after a missile struck the building. Shelling in the city has killed 17 people so far including an Indian student.
