By Gaurav C Sawant: As the war in Ukraine continues for the 17th straight day, the Russian troops are advancing steadily towards the capital city of Kyiv. The Russians are burning fuel to keep themselves warm as they are unable to move forward.
India Today spoke to a Ukranian TV anchor-turned soldier, Illia Berezenko, who is on the frontlines fighting against the Russian troops.
Amidst the war, with raining missiles and heavy shelling, Ukrainians have taken refuge in bomb shelters.
