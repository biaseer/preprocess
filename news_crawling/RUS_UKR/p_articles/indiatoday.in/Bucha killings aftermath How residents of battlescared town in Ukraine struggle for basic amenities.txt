By Gaurav C Sawant: Ukraine on Sunday accused Russian forces of carrying out a "massacre" in the town of Bucha after the nation saw bodies in a mass grave and lying on the streets.
Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian troops had found the bodies of women who had been raped and set alight as well as the bodies of local officials and children.
Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial against Russian President Vladimir Putin and additional sanctions following reported atrocities in Bucha.
Bucha's mayor said 300 residents had been killed during a month-long occupation by the Russian army.
There was no electricity, water or gas in the area. While many of the residents fled, a few families that remain in Bucha were seen cooking their food out in the open.
As images of the bodies emerged from Bucha, European leaders condemned the atrocities and called for tougher sanctions against Moscow.
