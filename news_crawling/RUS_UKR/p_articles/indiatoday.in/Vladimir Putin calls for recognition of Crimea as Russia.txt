Putin claimed that Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula should be internationally recognised as a legitimate reflection of the local population's choice, likening it to a vote for Kosovo independence.

By Associated Press: Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Tuesday for international recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, an end to Ukraine's Nato membership bid and a halt to weapons shipments there.
To end the current crisis, he also called for the renunciation of Ukraine's Nato bid, saying it should assume a neutral status, and said that the West should stop sending weapons there.
