By India Today Web Desk: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday said that there were some positive signals in the negotiations but warned Russia cannot be trusted.
Zelenkyy said, "Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas -- that only a concrete result can be trusted."
Russia announced after Tuesday's talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul, Turkey that it will significantly reduce military operations near Ukraine's capital of Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv.
He said Ukraine will continue the negotiation process to the extent depending on us but emphasised mistrust in the words coming from representatives of the country that continues to fight to destroy us.
In a video address on Tuesday night, Zelenskyy said, "We can call the signals we hear from the negotiating platform positive. But these signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells."
