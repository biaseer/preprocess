The vacuum bomb in Russias arsenal is a super-powerful non-nuclear bomb that has a blast equivalent to more than 44 tons of TNT. The Father Of All Bombs can cause damage to a radius of 300 metres.
Russia has launched an all-out attack on Ukraine, its neighbour and once a member of the erstwhile Soviet Union. The invasion is being seen by many as Putins attempt to redraw the global map and restore Russias Cold War-era dominance.
Kharkiv, which reported the massive blast, has been one of the primary targets of the Russian onslaught. Hundreds have also reportedly been injured in these devastating Russian attacks since Ukraine was invaded in a dawn attack on February 24.
By Sumana Nandy: A massive explosion lights up the night sky over Kharkiv, Ukraines second-largest city, a bone-chilling video posted by the war-torn countrys foreign ministry showed. Within seconds, the Russian bomb sent up a devastating mushroom cloud, triggering speculations over whether the Kremlin unleashed the Father Of All Bombs - a vacuum bomb - on its neighbour.

In another horrifying video, a volunteer while recording a video, reportedly talking in Russian about the things they had bought with donations from people for those camping in underground bunkers and shelters, accidentally captures a rocket attack. The terrifying clip, a little over 30 seconds, tapes a rocket hitting the residential building he was standing next to and splintered glass flying all over from the impact.
The camera keeps rolling as he crouches over to enter what seems like a tunnel with graffiti on the wall behind him. He escapes unhurt.
