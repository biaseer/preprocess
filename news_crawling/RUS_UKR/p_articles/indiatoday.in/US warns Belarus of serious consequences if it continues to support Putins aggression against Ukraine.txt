By India Today Web Desk: The United States has warned Belarus of facing "serious consequences" if its President Alexander Lukashenko continues to support his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin's aggression against Ukraine.
"Belarus will face serious consequences in case Lukashenko continues to support Putin 's aggression against Ukraine," US State Department spokesman Ned Price was quoted as saying by NEXTA TV during a briefing.
According to The Kyiv Independent, 65.16 per cent of citizens allegedly supported these constitutional amendments. Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko has also significantly extended his executive powers.
The talks are being held on the border with strong Russian ally Belarus, where a referendum on Sunday approved a new constitution ditching the country's non-nuclear status and paving the way for Russian nuclear weapons to be placed in the country.
On Monday, talks were held between Russian and Ukrainian officials at the Belarusian border with the aim of an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, the Ukrainian president's office had said.
