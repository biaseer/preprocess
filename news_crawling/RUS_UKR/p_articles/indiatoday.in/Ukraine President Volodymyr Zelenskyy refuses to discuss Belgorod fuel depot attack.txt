The regional governor in Belgorod said two workers at the depot were injured, but Russian media cited a statement from state oil company Rosneft that denied anyone was hurt.
Earlier, the secretary of Ukraine's national security council denied Moscow's allegations that two Ukrainian helicopter gunships had struck the facility in the city of Belgorod north of the border at around dawn Friday.
By Associated Press: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declined to comment on whether he ordered an attack on a Russian fuel depot.
