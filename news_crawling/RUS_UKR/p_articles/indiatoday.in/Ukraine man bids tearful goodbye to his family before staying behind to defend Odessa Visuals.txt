By India Today Web Desk: As the Russian attacks on Ukraine continue, over a million people have fled the country to escape the horrors of the war. In Ukraines Odessa, as a man bid a tearful goodbye to his family at the train station, the images of the scene capture the heartbreaking sequence.
In the photos shared by NEXTA, a media organisation based in Eastern Europe, an Odessa man can be seen bidding farewell to his family, while his family looks at him tearfully from inside the train. Through the fogged-up train window, the man is seen saying goodbye to his family, before walking away.

The UN human rights office says it has been able to confirm the deaths of 406 civilians in Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion. It said that another 801 injured civilians had been confirmed as of midnight Sunday. The rights office uses strict methodology and only reports casualties it has confirmed.
Under the martial law, Ukraine is not allowing men aged between 18 and 60 to leave the country as they attempt to battle the Russian invasion. Many women, too, are willingly taking up arms to fight Russian troops in the streets of Ukraines towns and cities.
The image of the man wiping away his tears after saying goodbye to his family as they evacuate Ukraine while he remains behind to defend the city, has become a scene repeated over and over again, too many times in the war-torn Ukraine.
