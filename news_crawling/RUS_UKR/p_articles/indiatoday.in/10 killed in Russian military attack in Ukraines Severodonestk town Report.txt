By India Today Web Desk: At least ten people have died in a Russian military attack in Ukraine's Severodonestk city, according to reports. This comes as Ukraine's war with Russia entered day 14. Several key cities in Ukraine have witnessed relentless shelling as Moscow escalated its military aggression, with eyes on the capital city of Kyiv.
The foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine are scheduled to meet this week in Turkey after talks held earlier failed to resolve the conflict.
The Pentagon on Tuesday estimated that Russia retains about 95 of the combat power it has deployed in Ukraine, accounting for weapons and vehicles destroyed or made inoperable as well as troops killed and wounded. Those losses, while modest at first glance, are significant for two weeks of fighting.
Two weeks of war have created a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine that has accelerated in recent days. The United Nations estimates that 2 million Ukrainians have fled their country, and the number is expected to grow.
Two weeks into its war in Ukraine, Russia has achieved less and struggled more than anticipated at the outset of the biggest land conflict in Europe since World War II. But the invading force of more than 150,000 troops retains large and possibly decisive advantages in firepower as they bear down on key cities.
