By India Today Web Desk: Russian forces fired missiles at several cities in Ukraine and landed troops on its coast, officials and media said, after President Vladimir Putin authorised what he called a special military operation in the east.
Russia has mobilised a massive military force near its border with Ukraine and their military capability gives them an upper hand - being the country with the fourth-biggest military budget in the world.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had carried out missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure and border guards, and that explosions had been heard in many cities. An official also reported non-stop cyber attacks.
Zelenskiy said that martial law had been declared and that he had spoken by telephone to Biden. Reservists were called up on Wednesday.
Three hours after Putin gave his order, Russia's defence ministry said it had taken out military infrastructure at Ukrainian air bases and degraded its air defences, Russian media reported.
The Russian forces far outweigh the military strength of Ukrainian forces by a massive margin with the number of their active personnel strength 8,50,000, paramilitary forces 2,50,000, naval fleet strength 605, total aircraft 4,173, helicopters 1,543, armoured vehicles 30,122, tank strength 12,420 attack helicopters 544 and fighter aircraft 772.
Russia has demanded an end to NATO's eastward expansion and Putin repeated his position that Ukrainian membership of the US-led Atlantic military alliance was unacceptable.
The full scope of the Russian military operation was not immediately clear but Putin said: "Our plans do not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories. We are not going to impose anything by force."
Russia's troop build-up along the border of Ukraine was in focus as satellite images showed heavy military deployment even as Russia made claims of withdrawal. With Russia announcing a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv has also vowed to defend itself.
Here's a look at Ukraine's military strength, active personnel strength 2,00,000, paramilitary forces 50,000, naval fleet strength 38, aircraft 318, helicopters 122, armoured vehicles 12,303, tank strength 2,596, attack helicopters 34 and fighter aircraft 69.
He said he had authorised military action after Russia had been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats emanating from modern Ukraine, a democratic state of 44 million people.
