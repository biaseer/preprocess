By India Today Web Desk: Russia will only use nuclear weapons when there is a "threat to the existence of the state", Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with PBS Newshour on Monday.
Days after Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Russian President Putin had announced on February 28 that he had put the country's strategic nuclear forces on high alert, triggering global alarm.
Dmitry Peskov said on Monday, "This is a statement that is certainly alarming. We will continue to track the statements of the US president in the most attentive way."
Now, in the interview on Monday, Dmitry Peskov said that any outcome of Russia's 'operation' in Ukraine would not be a reason for use of nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile, on US President Joe Biden's 'Putin cannot remain in power' remark, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a cause for 'alarm'.
"Any outcome of the operation in Ukraine, of course, is not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon," Peskov said.
"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," Biden had said on Saturday at the end of a speech to a crowd in Warsaw.
He added, "We have a security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a threat to the existence of the state, we can and will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat to the existence of our country.
