On Tuesday, Belarusian authorities said more than half of the country's voters approved constitutional reforms that would allow its authoritarian leader to stay in power until 2035 and open the way for stronger military cooperation with Russia, while the Belarusian opposition denounced the vote as a sham.
Hundreds of Belarusians took to the streets on Sunday in 15 cities across the country, protesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the biggest show of defiance in Belarus in two years.
Moscow had deployed forces to Belarusian territory weeks earlier under the pretext of joint military drills and then sent them rolling into Ukraine as part of a devastating attack that began last Thursday.
By India Today Web Desk: Belarus is preparing to send troops to Ukraine, the Ukrainian defense ministry was quoted by a report as saying. However, Belarus has not confirmed the deployment yet.
Belarus has been providing support for Russias war effort, but so far has not taken a direct part in the conflict.
