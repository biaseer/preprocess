Khrenin cited the increase in military activity near the external borders of the union state and the aggravation of the situation in Donbas - the region of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists.
Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said Sunday that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to continue testing the response forces of the union state.
Lukashenko joined Putin at the Kremlin on Saturday to observe Russian forces conduct nuclear drills, according to Russian officials.
Russia and Belarus have tight cooperation under an alliance referred to as the Union State, which stops short of the countries' actual integration.
By Associated Press: The defense minister of Belarus says his country's joint exercises with Russian troops will continue because of rising tensions in Ukraine.
