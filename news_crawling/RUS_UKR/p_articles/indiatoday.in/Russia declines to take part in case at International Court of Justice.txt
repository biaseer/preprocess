"We are in this building called the peace palace while my country faces aggression. We see the aggression of Russian bombs and missiles. Millions of people are in imminent danger. Russias assault on Ukraine has resulted in 1.5M people fleeing from the country and many more are internally displaced," Ukraine said.
"We can no longer provide state services to our citizens, including medical services. This is not the first time we have experienced Russias disrespect for international law firsthand. Now, the world understands Russias disrespect and hatred for humanity," it added.
The International Criminal Court has decided to launch an investigation into alleged war crimes committed amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I believe that alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine in relation to the events already assessed during the preliminary examination by the office, ICC Prosecutor Karim AA Khan QC said.
Last month, Ukraine filed a suit against Russia at the highest United Nations court in The Hague for disputes between states. Ukraine has also sought to involve another court in The Hague, the International Criminal Court ICC, which handles war crimes.
It said: "This is how Russia resolves disputes but Ukraine has another position and respects international laws."
By Nalini Singh: Russia has decided not to participate in the International Court of Justice proceedings. No representation on behalf of Russia.
"The UN International Court of Justice must immediately order Russia to end the war in Ukraine," Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said.
