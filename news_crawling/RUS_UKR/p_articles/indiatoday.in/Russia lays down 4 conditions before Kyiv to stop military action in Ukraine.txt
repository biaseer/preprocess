"They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc," he said.
"We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot," the Kremlin spokesman said.
By India Today Web Desk: Russia has told Ukraine it is ready to halt military operations "in a moment" if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, the Kremlin spokesman said on Monday.
Russia has attacked Ukraine from the north, east and south, pounding cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and the port of Mariupol. The invasion launched on February 24 has caused the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, provoked outrage across the world, and led to heavy sanctions on Moscow.
They need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And thats it. It will stop in a moment," the spokesman said.
It was the most explicit Russian statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt what it calls its "special military operation", now in its 12th day.
He added, "We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory.
