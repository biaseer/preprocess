Erdogan, who has friendly ties with both Russia and Ukraine, has sought to host the two countries leaders for a three-way summit in Turkey to ease tensions.
"And if Mr Putin also looks on this positively, we can, God willing, come together in Istanbul or Ankara," Erdogan said last week.

ISTANBUL AFP - Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday slammed Russias recognition of Ukraines breakaway regions as "unacceptable" in comments carried by the official Anadolu news agency.
In the meantime, Turkey, a member of NATO since 1952, has drawn Russias ire for selling drones to Ukraine in its conflict with pro-Moscow separatists.
Erdogan vocally opposed Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea because of the historical presence of ethnically-Turkic Tatars on the peninsula.
