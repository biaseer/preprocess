Reuters - Russian-backed separatists in a breakaway region of eastern Ukraine have blocked access to the search engine Google GOOGL.O, their leader said on Friday, citing what he calls "disinformation".
"If Google stops pursuing its criminal policy and returns to the mainstream of law, morality and common sense, there will be no obstacles to its work," he said.
In a message posted on his Telegram channel, Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic DPR, accused Google of promoting "violence against all Russians" and said that its "handlers from the U.S. government" were to blame.
Since sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia and its proxies in eastern Ukraine have accused Western companies of spreading anti-Russian propaganda and taking a one-sided stance on the conflict.
Russia banned Facebook and Instagram in March after a court found Facebook-owner Meta guilty of "extremist activity". Moscow had already curbed access to Facebook for restricting Russian media outlets access to the platform.
The DPR and separate Luhansk Peoples Republic LPR followed suit in blocking Facebook and Instagram, aligning themselves with Russias policy on the U.S.-based social networks.
