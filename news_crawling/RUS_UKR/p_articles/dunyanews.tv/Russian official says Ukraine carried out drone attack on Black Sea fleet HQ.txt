Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, prompting a major row with the West which deepened over Moscows role in an insurgency of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
An unidentified object flew into the courtyard of the fleets headquarters, Mikhail Razvozhayev, governor of Sevastopol, home to Russias Black Sea fleet, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
Reuters - A senior official in Russian-annexed Crimea accused Ukraine on Sunday of carrying out a drone attack ahead of planned celebrations to mark Navy Day, injuring five and forcing the cancellation of festivities.
All celebrations have been cancelled for security reasons, Razvozhayev said. Please remain calm and stay home if possible.
Razvozhayev said that five employees of the fleet headquarters had been injured in the incident and that the Federal Security Service FSB was investigating its circumstances.
The accusation comes hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to oversee Navy Day celebrations in his hometown of St Petersburg and approve Russias naval doctrine as Moscow presses on with its military intervention in Ukraine.
Navy Day is an annual Russian holiday during which its fleets stage naval parades and honour its sailors.
