A spokesman for the Polish foreign ministry said the move came as "Russia is waging a barbaric war against Ukraine for more than three weeks.
Earlier Wednesday, Polands counter-espionage service ABW announced it had detained a Polish national suspected of espionage for Russias secret services.
"The detainee worked in the archives of Warsaws registry office," ABW spokesman Stanislaw Zaryn said on Twitter.
"And we and other Western countries are treated by Russia as its key adversary," Lukasz Jasina said.
"Tolerating this type of illegal activity by Russian services would especially threaten Polands security and the security of our NATO and European Union allies, with whom we coordinate all of our activities like this," he added.
"The activity of the suspect posed a threat to both the internal and external security of Poland," he added.
"There are no grounds for these kinds of accusations," he said, adding that Russia reserved the right to take retaliatory measures.
Russian ambassador to Poland Sergey Andreyev confirmed the expulsions, telling reporters that the individuals concerned had been given five days to leave Poland.
"Poland has expelled 45 Russian spies pretending to be diplomats," he wrote. "We are dismantling the Russian special services network in our country."
WARSAW AFP - Poland on Wednesday said it had expelled 45 Russian diplomats for espionage, an allegation immediately dismissed as baseless by Russias ambassador to Poland.
