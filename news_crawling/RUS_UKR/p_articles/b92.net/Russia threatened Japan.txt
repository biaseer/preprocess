Russia has warned Japan and threatened "retaliation" if joint naval exercises with the United States expand to Russia's eastern borders, CNN writes.
This threat is just a continuation of the conflict between Moscow and Tokyo. Moscow is furious that Japan has given unequivocal support to Ukraine and is getting closer to NATO member states. Russia and Japan, in fact, have had unresolved relations since the end of World War II because of the islands that were then occupied by Soviet forces.  Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said on Tuesday that the US-Japanese naval exercises were "potentially offensive in nature", according to a report by the Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti.  "We see such actions of the Japanese side as a threat to the security of our country," Morgulov said.  "If this practice continues, Russia will take retaliatory measures in the interest of strengthening its defense capabilities."
