Later on Friday, Ukraines defence intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on television that Ukraines coast was defended by onshore rocket systems, and that Russia had tried and failed to get several unacceptable conditions for Ukraine into the deal.
Speaking on television, infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov cited the recapture of Snake Island, a small but strategically located outcrop near several key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea, as an important moment.
But none of these points will be implemented. And Russia eventually agreed to this, he added.
Russia really wanted to escort grain convoys with warships, wanted to inspect some things on Ukrainian territory, and so on, Budanov said.
KYIV Reuters      Ukraines infrastructure minister, who signed the U.N.-led deal to unblock Ukraines ports for grain exports in Turkey on Friday, said the agreement was only possible thanks to Ukraines military successes.
Kubrakov also said that Ukraine does not see the risk of Russian ships reaching Ukrainian ports through green corridors agreed by the deal, as they would be fired upon by Ukrainian missiles in the case of such an attempt.
