Ukrainian officials have previously accused Moscow of basing troops and storing military equipment on the grounds of the power station.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.s atomic watchdog, should be given access to the plant, Blinken said.
Washington was deeply concerned that Moscow was now using the plant as a military base and firing on Ukrainian forces from around it, Blinken told reporters after nuclear nonproliferation talks at the United Nations in New York.
On July 20 Russia accused Ukraine of firing two drones at Zaporizhzhia, which is also the largest nuclear plant in Europe, but said the reactor was undamaged.
Russias actions went beyond using a human shield Blinken said, calling it a nuclear shield.
Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant, he said.
The Russian mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Blinkens remarks.
UNITED NATIONS Reuters      U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday called Russias actions around Ukraines largest nuclear power plant the height of irresponsibility, accusing Moscow of using it as a nuclear shield in attacks on Ukrainian forces.
At a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Friday, Russias deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy accused his Western counterparts of deliberately ignoring the July 20 attack and use of explosive-laden drones of foreign manufacture to attack the plant.
Russia was previously accused of firing shells dangerously close to the Zaporizhzhia plant in March as its forces took it over in the first weeks of its invasion of Ukraine.
