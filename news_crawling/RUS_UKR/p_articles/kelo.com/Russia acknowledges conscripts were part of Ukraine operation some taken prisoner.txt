Reuters  Russias defence ministry acknowledged on Wednesday that some conscripts were taking part in the conflict with Ukraine after multiple denials by President Vladimir Putin, who said only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in.
Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia, it said, promising to prevent such situations in the future.
The ministry said that some of them, serving in supply units, had been taken prisoner by the Ukrainian army.
