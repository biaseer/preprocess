VIENNA Reuters      Russias control of radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl is limiting the flow of information out of them such that Ukraine cannot fully answer all the International Atomic Energy Agencys  questions, the Ukrainian nuclear regulator has told the IAEA.
The regulator said for the first time today that information it received regarding Chornobyl was controlled by the Russian military forces and therefore it could not always provide detailed answers to all of the IAEAs questions, the IAEA said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that was also the case at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
