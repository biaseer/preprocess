Reuters -Five buses and an armoured personnel carrier carrying Ukraines servicemen from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol arrived late on Monday in Novoazovsk, a Reuters witness said.
Earlier, a Reuters witness reported that about a dozen of buses left the steel plant. Russian media reported that some of the buses went to a location other than Novoazovsk.
Novoazovsk is now under the control of Russia-backed separatists who have held parts of eastern Ukraine since 2014.
Some of the evacuees were carried out of the buses on stretchers and carried into a hospital, the witness said.
