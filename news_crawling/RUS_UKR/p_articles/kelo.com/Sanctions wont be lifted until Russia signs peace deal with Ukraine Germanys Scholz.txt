BERLIN Reuters      The sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine will not be lifted until Moscow reaches a peace agreement with Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, adding that it was for Ukraine to decide what peace it wanted.
He didnt think his entire Ukraine operation through, Scholz said. He didnt think Ukraine would resist like that. He didnt think we would support them to hold out for so long We wont withdraw the sanctions unless he reaches an agreement with Ukraine, and he wont get that with a dictated peace.
He added that he had no plans to visit Kyiv after a planned trip by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier had been dropped due to Ukraines objections.
Interviewed on ZDF public television, Scholz said Putin had miscalculated if he had anticipated that he might be able to gain territory from Ukraine, declare an end to hostilities and see Western countries drop sanctions.
