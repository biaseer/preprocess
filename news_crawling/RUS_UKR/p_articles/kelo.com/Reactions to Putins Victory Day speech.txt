NATO countries were not going to attack Russia. Ukraine did not plan to attack Crimea.
Reuters      Russian President Vladimir Putin evoked the memory of Soviet heroism in World War Two on Monday to urge his army towards victory in Ukraine, saying the West had been preparing for the invasion of our land, including Crimea.
Putin was speaking at the annual Victory Day parade on Moscows Red Square marking the anniversary of the Soviet Unions victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.
There can be no victory day, only dishonour and surely defeat in Ukraine He Putin must come to terms with how hes lost in the long run, and hes absolutely lost. Russia is not what it was.
