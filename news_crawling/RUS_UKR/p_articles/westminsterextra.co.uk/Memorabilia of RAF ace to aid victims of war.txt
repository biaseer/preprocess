After the outbreak of war in 1939 Bader returned to the RAF scoring his first victories over Dunkirk during the Battle of France and later the Battle of Britain.
He remained there until April 1945 when it was liberated. Bader left the RAF permanently in February 1946 and went on to campaign for the disabled.
A CAP and flying scarf worn by an RAF legend is being auctioned for 25,000 to help victims of Russias war on Ukraine.
And 40 per cent of the proceeds are being donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee which brings together 15 leading charities, including the Red Cross and Oxfam, a mystery seller has stipulated.
He joined the RAF in 1928 but in 1931, while attempting some aerobatics, he crashed and lost both his legs.
Sir Douglas is credited with 22 aerial victories and is arguably the most famous British World War II fighter pilot.
Organisers described the historic lot as an extraordinary survival from one of the greatest aces of all time, adding: An example of determination against all the odds.
Despite this, as the legend has it, he retook his pilot training before being retired on medical grounds.
In August 1941 Bader bailed out of his plane behind enemy lines. He tried to escape but was imprisoned in Colditz Castle.
The cap and scarf are on display at the Connect Art Fair, open this weekend.
