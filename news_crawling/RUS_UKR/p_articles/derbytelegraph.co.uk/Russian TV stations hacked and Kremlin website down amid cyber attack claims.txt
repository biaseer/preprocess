The RIA news agency has reported that the authorities have received messages threatening to place bombs at Moscow's railway stations and airports.
The Kremlin's official website, kremlin.ru, was offline on Saturday February 26 amid claims of cyber attacks on other Russian government and state media websites.
It also said that the Russian embassy in London was in touch with British police after receiving phone threats related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, described by Putin as a "special military operation".
"Unfortunately it seems you have made the option to ignore our presence and therefore we have decided to dedicate an operation specifically for you.
In the message, they urged Putin to step down and recognise the rights of Ukrainian citizens, The Mirror reports.
And the hacker collective Anonymous posted a video message in which a member of the shadowy group spoke directly to President Vladimir Putin.
The message referenced other occasions when Anonymous has taken websites offline, and went on to say: ""Your recent attempt to threaten Finland and Sweden is shameful.
"We are now asking for you to restore the rights of the Ukrainian people and resign as an elected official."
Russian TV stations were broadcasting Ukrainian songs tonight after apparently being hacked - with all of Russia's government web pages down too.
"We have been patiently waiting for you to respond to our most recent request, but we find ourselves growing impatient of your foot dragging.
