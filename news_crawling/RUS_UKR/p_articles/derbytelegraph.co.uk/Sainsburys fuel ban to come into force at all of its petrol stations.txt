Rhian Bartlett, food commercial director at Sainsbury's, said We stand united with the people of Ukraine and have taken a range of steps to show our support  from helping to fund the humanitarian effort on the ground, to removing products from our stores which are 100 sourced from Russia.
It comes amid pressure on retailers and energy firms to shake off their reliance on Russia for certain products after the country launched an assault on Ukraine in February. Russia is the third-biggest oil producer in the world behind Saudi Arabia and the United States.
There are wide-ranging financial sanctions and restrictions taken by the West following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
The move comes following pressure from customers. Sainsbury's  stocking many Russian goods on its shelves though phasing out the use of Russian oil in fuel is more complex to undertake and could impact prices at the pumps.
This is a complex process but we are committed to working together with the rest of the UK fuel industry and Government to support the ban on Russian oil imports, which is due to take effect by the end of this year.
Diesel and petrol prices remain historically high, figures show, triggered largely by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Statistics from data firm Experian Catalist show diesel prices reached an average of 181.0p per litre on Wednesday, up from 180.9p a day earlier, Kent Live reports.
Supermarket giant Sainsbury's is phasing out the sale of Russian diesel at its petrol stations as it pledges its support for the people of Ukraine. There will be no Russian diesel available at any of Sainsbury's 315 forecourts by the end of 2022.
We have been working hard to reduce the amount of diesel we sell which comes from Russia since the early days of the conflict.
