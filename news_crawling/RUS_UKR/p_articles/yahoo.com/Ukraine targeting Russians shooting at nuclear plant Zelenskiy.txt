Zelenskiy also gave an update on Ukraines efforts on the frontline, describing the fighting in Donbas as brutal.
Zelenskiy, who did not give any details, repeated accusations that Russia was using the plant as nuclear blackmail.
STORY: Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations over multiple recent incidents of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia facility, Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Russian troops captured the station early in the war.
"Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots using the plant as cover, must understand that he becomes a special target for our intelligence agents, for our special services, for our army," Zelenskiy said in an evening video address.
And absolutely all officials of the terrorist state, as well as those who help them in this blackmail operation with the nuclear power plant, must answer in an international court, he said.
Fighting in the south of the country brings good news about the destruction of Russian army forces and their means. No day is wasted - we are reducing the occupiers' potential, he added.
