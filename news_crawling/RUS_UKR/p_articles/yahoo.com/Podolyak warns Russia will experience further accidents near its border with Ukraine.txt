Podolyak added that Russias demilitarization will only ramp up in the coming weeks, especially in areas close to the Ukrainian border.
Panic will grow and spread there, conflicts will flare up, warehouses and depots will continue to explode all this will only intensify, he said.
Those fuel depots that will keep exploding will be Russia starting to make its war debt payments.
Ukraine is widely thought to be responsible for the accidents, and is believed to have attacked them with helicopters and missiles, but Kyiv has not said it was behind the incidents so far.
Russia has in recent weeks suffered a series of explosions and fires at oil depots and military arms depots in its Belgorod and Bryansk oblasts, which neighbor Ukrainian territory.
