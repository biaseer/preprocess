While earlier they wanted to hold this pseudo-referendum in late August, today they dont see how to hold it even on Sept. 11.
Today theyre not talking about the only referendum day for several reasons. The extremely low turnout and activity of our residents regarding participation in this sham referendum is the first and main reason. Thats why today they reformatted and want to do it as part of a sociological survey on Sept. 11-17 and then sum up the results.
In this way, theyre trying to say that no one is trying to suppress the Ukrainian population, but we clearly understand that this is another batch of propaganda, the mayor said.
U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War ISW said on Aug. 26 that the Russian occupation authorities are unlikely to be able to carry out referendums as they intend with cooperation from local collaborators by the purported Sept. 11 deadline, due to continued frictions within occupation administrations and ongoing partisan attacks.
Fedorov added the Russians had also formed demands for the so-called agitation groups. In particular, a resident of Ukraines Russian-occupied Crimea who lived there until 2014 and is fluent in Ukrainian, should be among them.
