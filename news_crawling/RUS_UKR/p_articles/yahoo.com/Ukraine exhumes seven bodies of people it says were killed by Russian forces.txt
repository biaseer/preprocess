"This is another sadistic crime of the Russian army in the Kyiv region," Kyiv region's police chief, Andriy Nyebytov, said on Facebook.
The bodies were found outside the village of Vorzel, less than 10 kilometres from the town of Bucha, where Kyiv alleges that Russian forces who occupied the area carried out systematic executions in an abortive attempt to capture the capital. Russia denies that.
Investigators said it would take time to clearly identify the bodies because they had decomposed.
"He has two injuries. He was shot in the knee with a gun. The second shot was into his temple," he said.
One of the exhumed bodies was that of a man around 40 years old in plain clothes, Nyebytov told Reuters at the site of the graves.
Russian officials have dismissed the mass graves in Bucha as a "fabrication" staged by Ukrainian authorities after Russian forces left the town at the end of March. Russia says it does not target civilians in what it calls a "special military operation".
