Russian troop movements near Ukraine's borders https:www.reuters.comworldeuropewhy-is-russias-putin-so-focused-ukraine-2021-12-15 have alarmed Kyiv and its Western allies in recent weeks. The soldiers say they are ready for any escalation from Russia.
Another serviceman, who gave his name as Oleh, played down the prospect of a major escalation.
Russia denies it is planning an offensive and accuses Kyiv of building up its own forces in the east of the country. But Moscow has demanded security guarantees it wants from the West in order to defuse the current crisis.
"We are determined to stand firm, we will not give up our country. We fought for independence for a long time," said one serviceman, who gave his nom-de-guerre as Martin.

"If they show off their muscles and rattle their sabres, then it is unlikely they will attack. If someone wants to attack, he does it covertly," he said.
Inside the trench, another soldier stands in front of a small Christmas tree, with messages and drawings from well-wishers pinned on the wall behind him.
