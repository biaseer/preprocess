Both sides gave conflicting accounts of Thursday's shelling and the details could not be established independently.
Earlier in February, the Sea of Azov became open to shipping again after Russia withdrew previously announced restrictions for ships due to the naval drills in the area.
The trip came at a time when Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces traded accusations of firing shells across the ceasefire line in eastern Ukraine, and Kyiv said the incidents looked like a "provocation" at a time when Russia has troops massed on the frontier.
