"Thanks to the timely and effective response of the air defence forces, the missiles did not hit the targets the enemy had been aiming at," it said.

Governor Maksym Marchenko earlier said three missiles had hit a residential area, adding there were casualties.
Russia has denied targeting civilians in its war in Ukraine that began on Feb. 24 in what Moscow calls a "special operation" to demilitarize its southwestern neighbour. Western countries call it an unprovoked war of aggression.
