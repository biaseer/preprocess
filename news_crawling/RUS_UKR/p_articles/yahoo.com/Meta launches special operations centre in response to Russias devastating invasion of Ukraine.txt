"Were taking extensive steps to fight the spread of misinformation, and labelling content from state-controlled media and content that fact checkers have rated false. And our cybersecurity teams are monitoring closely for coordinated attempts to abuse our platform.
The company, which owns Facebook and Twitter, also rolled out extra security to Ukrainian users letting them protect their accounts.
Metas reputation on protecting foreign users has been mixed. In August last year it brought in new security measures to protect its users in Afghanistan over concerns that the Taliban could use them to track opponents of the government, but in years past it had not been as effective  admitting in 2018 that it did not do enough to curb hate speech in Myanmar that caused attacks on the Rohingya Muslims.
"Weve established a Special Operations Center, staffed by experts and native speakers, to respond in real time to remove hate speech or content that incites violence or otherwise breaks our rules.
"The situation in Ukraine is devastating," the companys president of global affairs and the UKs former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said.
Misinformation is already spreading across social media, such as a clip taken from a video game which amass millions of views as users falsely claimed it depicted real attacks.
YouTube has also continued to host Russian propaganda channels, putting pressure on Google to step in.
Meta has created a dedicated task force in order to fight misinformation about Russias invasion of Ukraine.
Another video, of a claimed Russian fighter jet being shot down, was actually from Libya over a decade ago.
Russian troops have launched a full scale invasion with an attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv expected within the day.
