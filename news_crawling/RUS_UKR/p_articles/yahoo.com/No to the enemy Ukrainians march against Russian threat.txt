"Today we want to say: "No to the enemy!" We want to say that Ukraine will be one," said Lviv resident and artist Mariya Yanko.
Ukrainians filed through the centre of the city in a column, chanting "One united Ukraine" and carrying Ukrainian flags and banners that said "Ukrainians will resist".
"We should show and demonstrate to those that are afraid, who think they have to flee the country, that we have the power and that we should stay here to defend our land," 22-year-old student Vladyslav Karpenko told Reuters.
