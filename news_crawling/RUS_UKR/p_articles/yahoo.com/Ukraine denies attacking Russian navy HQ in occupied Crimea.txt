Russia accused Ukraine of using a drone to attack Russian Black Sea Fleet HQ in Sevastopol on July 31, claiming that five people were left injured.
What actually happened was they decided to eschew celebrating their Navy Day, and decided to conjure up this phantom of a Ukrainian attack, in order to save face and cancel their festivities.
Ukrainian defense forces are proceeding to liberate our lands, by the means, we have at our disposal, the message noted.
The message suggests that Russian forces in occupied Ukrainian territories are getting paranoid about the growing reach of Kyivs armed forces.
We aim for legitimate Russian military targets. We do not attack inside Russian territory. Crimea is Ukraine.

Moreover, these Russian claims further undermine the perceived effectiveness of Moscows anti-air defenses, raising concerns about the security of the Kerch Strait Bridge, which links the peninsula to the Russian mainland, according to Kyiv.
The enemy would have you believe that an unidentified flying device flew to Russian Black Sea Fleet HQ in Sevastopol and injured five people this morning, the message said.
