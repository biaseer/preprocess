Mariupol was under siege by the Russian invaders for almost three months. Russia's actions led to a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe, as the invaders bombed residential areas and civilian infrastructure, as well as continually blocking humanitarian aid.
At the same time, Andriushchenko did not specify in which area and when exactly the train had been destroyed.
