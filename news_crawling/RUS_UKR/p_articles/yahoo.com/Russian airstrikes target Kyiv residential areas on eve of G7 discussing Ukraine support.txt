Russia attacked Ukraine's capital on Sunday, striking at least two residential buildings and causing extensive damage. It was the first attack on Kyiv in nearly three weeks and one most likely timed to the meeting of G-7 leaders in Germany that got underway Sunday to discuss ongoing support for Ukraine. CBS News foreign correspondent Ramy Inocencio reports.
