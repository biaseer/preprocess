He said that the invaders in this manner plan to satisfy the ambitions of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin for the annual celebration in Moscow of the Allies victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.
According to Haidai, the Russians will use heavy weapons, including artillery, multiple rocket launchers such as Grad, Smerch, and aircraft, to attack Luhansk Oblast.
And they will simply bomb, launch massive attacks, and try to destroy the infrastructure of Luhansk Oblast that is inaccessible to them, the governor said.
