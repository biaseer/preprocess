The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.
U.S. intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 750,000 troops.
Speaking at the G7 foreign ministers' meeting in the UK's Liverpool, Truss also said the Group of Seven major industrialized countries are also concerned about the "coercive" economic policies of China.
