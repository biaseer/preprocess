Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova says a Russian attack on the port of Odesa, just days after reaching an agreement to resume shipments of grain, is an example of Russia "showing their true face," and "the good response to that should be more weapons to Ukraine so that we can defend ourselves."
