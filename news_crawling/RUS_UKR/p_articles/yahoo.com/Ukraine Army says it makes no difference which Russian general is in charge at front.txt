"It will not change anything, the Russian army acts in a barbaric way, regardless of who is in charge of it," Motuzianyk said.
"We know about the new commanders, who fights in what way. The Russian army fights in a manner that is quite clear for us: they have almost no chance in direct clashes with Ukrainian servicemen."
"That's why the Russian side destroys everything with artillery, and then the infantry 'heroically' enters there," Motuzianyk said.
He was answering a question about whether the death of Russian Major General Roman Kutuzov in fighting in Ukraine would mean any changes in enemy tactics.
This is the fourth military leader whose death in the war in Ukraine has been officially confirmed by Russia.
According to the official, the Russians have trained special forces, but the Russian infantry has mostly no chance in battles with Ukraines motivated, experienced, professional servicemen.
