According to Ryzhenko, so far, these wooden structures have only managed to "protect" the passage to the city's Court of Appeal.
Russian occupiers in the area are preparing for the liberation of the Kherson by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, by conducting raids in search of Ukrainian partisans who are arranging various sabotage, both in the city itself and in other settlements of the Oblast.
Kherson Regional Council member Serhiy Khlan stated that the last transport artery for Khersons Russian occupational garrison was the Kakhovka Bridge, which was disabled as a result of a missile strike on Aug. 10.
Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military is destroying bridges across the Dnipro River in order to damage the invaders logistics.
This barbecue firewood near the Court of Appeal is supposed to be an antitank hedgehog, Ryzhenko wrote sarcastically.
