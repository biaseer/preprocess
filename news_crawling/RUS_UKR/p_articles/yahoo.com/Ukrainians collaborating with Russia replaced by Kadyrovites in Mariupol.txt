In Mariupol, the Russian invaders plan to forcibly attract citizens to the ranks of the so-called "voluntary squads."
Petro Andriushchenko, Advisor to Mariupols Mayor, said that Russian occupiers are changing over the command of the filtration camps and checkpoints on the outskirts of Mariupol.
The Ukrainian authorities have received indirect confirmation that the Russian occupiers, having almost destroyed Mariupol, plan to give it to the Kadyrovites Chechen paramilitaries supporting the Russian Armed Forces.
Quote from Andriushchenko: "Our sources in the city say that there is a change over of the occupation forces at the checkpoints and filtration points on the way from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia.
Reporters later found out that the footage of the Kadyrovites fighting in supposedly different parts of Mariupol was in fact filmed in one city park.
In March, soldiers of the Azov Regiment defending Mariupol "trolled" Kadyrov who shared a video in which his troops fire on the empty windows of destroyed residential buildings and on traffic lights in an attempt to simulate heavy fighting with "banderovites."
Russian reporters claim that units of the Russian Armed Forces subordinate to Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov suffer significant losses, with large numbers of both dead and wounded soldiers, but are able to cover them up using social media.
Collaborators and representatives of the so-called peoples militia of the DPR the self-declared Donetsk Peoples Republic - ed. are replaced with members of the Russian Guard and Kadyrovites."
