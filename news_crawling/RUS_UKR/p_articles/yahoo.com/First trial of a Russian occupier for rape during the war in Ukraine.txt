"Investigators of the Ukrainian special services have gathered enough evidence and eyewitness accounts to bring to justice a Russian serviceman suspected of killing and raping Kyiv residents," the Security Service said.
The pre-trial investigation in this case was conducted by investigators of the Main Directorate of the Security Service of Ukraine in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast.
The investigation established that in March, during the occupation of the Brovary district, Romanov broke into a house in one of the villages and shot the owner.
The accused is Mikhail Romanov from the city of Chebarkul, Chelyabinsk Oblast, according to the Prosecutors Office and the Security Service of Ukraine.
"Even though the accused is not in our hands at the moment, he will not escape a fair trial and responsibility before the law," said Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova.
They threatened the woman with murder and with violence against her young son, who was hiding in the boiler room.
The Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine has opened the first case of rape during the war: a Russian serviceman, who tormented Ukrainians in Kyiv region, will be tried.
The Kyiv Oblast Prosecutor's Office has already sent an indictment to the court in a special pre-trial investigation into Romanov for violating the laws and customs of war parts 1 and 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
