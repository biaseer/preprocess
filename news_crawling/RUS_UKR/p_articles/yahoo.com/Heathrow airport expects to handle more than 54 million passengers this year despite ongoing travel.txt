All carriers contacted by the broadcaster, including EasyJet and British Airways, were unable to provide a timeline for an end to last-minute flight cancelations that have caused chaotic scenes in airports across the UK.
London Heathrow expects to handle 54.4 million passengers this year despite the travel chaos affecting air travel this summer, according to an investor report released on Thursday.
In April the airport said it forecast 52.8 million passengers but had raised the outlook due to a "steady traffic increase in 2022".
Staff shortages and the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are among some of the reasons blamed for the surge in cancelations.
The increase in passengers comes despite airlines being unable to say when a wave of flight cancelations will end, Sky News reported.
Heathrow said it was "working closely" with airlines and ground handlers to match supply with demand amid ongoing travel disruption, but warned: "Rebuilding resource and capacity across all European airports including airlines and ground handlers is expected to take at least 12 months."
Last week it also reopened Terminal 4, which had remained closed since the pandemic struck.
It said it was on track to recruit up to 1,000 new security officers this year and was working with airlines to increase automation at check-in.
London Heathrow has increased its passenger forecast for the year, according to an investor report.
The number of last-minute flight cancelations has prompted the UK government and aviation regulator to order airlines to ensure their summer schedules are deliverable.
Britain's biggest airport has already handled 20.1 million passengers this year even before the summer peak summer, overtaking the total for all of 2021.
