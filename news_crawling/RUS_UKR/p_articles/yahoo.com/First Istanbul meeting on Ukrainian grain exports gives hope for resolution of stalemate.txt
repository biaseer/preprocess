As reported by Reuters citing sources among diplomats, the parties discussed the departure of ships with grain from the ports accompanied by Ukrainian ships on the condition that Russia agrees to a ceasefire during the movement of cargo, and Turkey, with the support of the United Nations, will inspect the ships to "allay Russian fears over arms smuggling".

Kremlin officials demanded that sanctions imposed on Russia for the war against Ukraine be lifted in exchange for the unblocking of Ukrainian ports.
Earlier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, said that the negotiations regarding Russia's unblocking of Ukrainian ports for the resumption of grain exports to the international market were at the final stage.
Russia has deliberately blocked Ukrainian ports and sea routes in the Black Sea, disabling the export of grain from Ukraine, and has also prevented exports by rail, launching missile strikes on elevators, railway infrastructure, and even crop fields, causing fires.
