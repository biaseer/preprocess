Johnsons visit comes amid concerns that European support for Ukraines battle against Russia could dry up amid the cost of living crisis.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Ukraines independence day.
We dont care what army you have, we only care about our land. We will fight for it until the end, Zelenskyy said in a video address on Wednesday.
Back in London, Downing Street is adorned with sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, to mark the occasion.
The British prime minister shared a photograph of himself alongside President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and tweeted: What happens in Ukraine matters to us all.
Zelenskyy has vowed to fight against Vladimir Putins invasion until the end and pledged he would not make any concession or compromise to end the conflict.
The Telegraph reported that U.K. diplomats have been travelling to European capitals to make the case against cutting aid to Kyiv.
That is why I am in Kyiv today. That is why the UK will continue to stand with our Ukrainian friends.
