Speaking Friday on the state-owned news channel Russia-24, Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy, deputy chief of staff of Russias armed forces, said the "first stage" of what Russian President Vladimir Putin has called a "special military operation" is complete and the military will now focus on the complete liberation of the separatist Donbas region.
The battlefield development came as Ukrainian officials, citing eyewitnesses, said some 300 people had died after Russian forces bombed a theater where more than 1,000 had taken refuge in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the claim, which involved an attack that has become an emblem of Russia's indiscriminate bombardment of civilian targets.
The city of Kherson in southern Ukraine near Russian-occupied Crimea is "contested territory again," a U.S. Defense Department official said. If the city is retaken, it would represent a major setback for Russia.
The announcements Friday came as President Joe Biden traveled to Poland for the second leg of an emergency trip to Europe to fortify the West's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Biden was briefed on the humanitarian response to the war, which has forced more than 3.6 million people to flee Ukraine to neighboring countries, with more than 2.1 million seeking refuge in Poland.
