Putin told Johnson the NATO bloc was not ready to adequately react to Russian concerns, according to the statement on the Kremlin website.
MOSCOW Reuters - Russian President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed Ukraine and the issue of security guarantees for Russia in a phone call on Wednesday, the Kremlin said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Russia mocked Johnson as "utterly confused" and ridiculed British politicians for their "stupidity and ignorance", hurling more scorn at the West after President Vladimir Putin accused Washington of trying to provoke war.
