He added that the countrys authorities would find alternative ways to export grain, amid fears that millions could go hungry because large parts of the world rely on Ukraine for their food supply.
The citys governor said that Oleksiy Vadatursky, one of the countrys richest men, and his wife, Raisa, had been killed in the attack.
Ukraines harvest could be up to 50 per cent smaller than usual this year because of Russias war, Volodymyr Zelensky has warned.
A hotel, a sports complex, two schools, a service station and some homes were destroyed during the shelling, which the mayor described as the strongest of all time.
Russian forces have targeted ports, grain depots, livestock and crops during the conflict. Just hours after the two countries signed the grain deal on 22 July, Russian forces fired precision missiles into the port of Odesa as grain was being prepared for export.
Mr Vadatursky, 74, owned Nibulon, a major agricultural firm that specialises in the production and export of grains including wheat, barley and corn.
In a statement published on Sunday morning, President Zelenksy said that in spite of the depleted harvest, Ukraines main goal was to prevent a global food crisis.
Authorities said the city of Mykolaiv, about 100km northwest of Kherson, near the Black Sea, had suffered a massive Russian bombardment overnight.
Earlier this month, Ukraine and Russia signed an agreement with the United Nations and Turkey on reopening Black Sea routes, blocked by Moscow, in order to resume grain exports.
It is feared, however, that the Kremlin could renege on its promises and continue to use grain as a weapon of war.
