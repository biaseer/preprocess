ROMAN PETRENKO - SATURDAY, 30 APRIL 2022, 13:46 The so-called FSB Russian Federal Security Service in occupied Crimea is gathering Crimean Tatars at a "congress" to stage a picture of their support for the war against Ukraine. Source: People's Deputy and Chairman of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis Refat Chubarov on Facebook, Kremlin media Chubarov's quote: "In Crimea, on 30 April, under the control of the FSB, the local occupation authorities are "calling together" a "congress of representatives", which, due to the lack of a significant number of Crimean Tatar collaborators, will require the attendance of students of the Crimean Engineering and Pedagogical University and also employees of state-funded organisations, in particular school teachers. The only reason that the Russian FSB is organising this "congress" is to make it look as if Crimean Tatars support "Putin's policy and the special military operation" against Ukraine." At the same time, Putin's media have already written that Crimean Tatars are allegedly "ready to take part in the Russian special operation in Ukraine as volunteers." Also, Crimean Tatars allegedly "support Putin's course and are ready to defend Russia's sovereignty together with the entire multinational population."
