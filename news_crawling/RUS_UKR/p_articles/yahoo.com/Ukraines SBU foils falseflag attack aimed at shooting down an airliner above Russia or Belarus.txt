A number of Russian agents were tasked with obtaining a Stinger system and smuggling it to Russia.
This group included two individuals with dual citizenship, as well as one local Ukrainian collaborator, and coordinated by Alexander Marine Tyuterev  a Russian citizen employed by the Main Directorate of Russias General Staff.
After establishing their patriotic volunteer fighters bona fides, the Russian espionage group planned to leverage this relationship into getting a hold of a foreign-made MANPAD system.
The SBU says it apprehended the entire cell in a special operation. Detailed investigation of the foiled false flag attack is ongoing, and the perpetrators are expected to face criminal charges.
Tyuterev is wanted for his earlier involvement in plotting a series of attacks in Odesa oblast.

During the course of the investigation, it became apparent that Russian security services have degraded substantially. In particular, Marine Tyuterev was shown to have been misleading his superiors about his alleged successes in Ukraine. He ordered his agents in Ukraine to fabricate evidence of a successful covert attack in Ukraine: they were manufacturing staged video and photo evidence of a supposed attack on a Territorial Defense Force checkpoint.
To achieve their goals, these enemy agents attempted to gain the trust of members of Ukraines Armed Forces by divulging accurate information about the movement of Russias so-called kadyrovtsi regiments  units under the personal command of Putin vassal and Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov.
The SBU says that the attack had been planned by members of Russias general staff, using a U.S.-made Stinger MANPAD.
