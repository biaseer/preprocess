Russian forces have bombed Ukrainian hospitals at least 34 times, a new independent analysis shows.
If proven to be deliberate by prosecutors, the attacks constitute war crimes, the AP reported.
Russian forces have attacked Ukrainian hospitals and medical facilities at least 34 times since the war began last month, according to a new analysis by the Associated Press.
As part of the "War Crimes Watch Ukraine" project with PBS series "Frontline," the AP independently documented the Russian attacks on a daily basis since the war began and said that the attacks could constitute evidence of war crimes.
The Associated Press tracked the attacks daily as part of a larger project with PBS series "Frontline."
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale military assault on Ukraine, and in the weeks since, during the fighting Russian forces have bombed a maternity ward, targeted attacks on civilian towns, and killed journalists amid the ongoing conflict.
The pattern of attacks "shows evidence of a consistent and relentless onslaught against the very civilian infrastructure designed to save lives and provide safe haven to Ukraine's most vulnerable," the report said.
