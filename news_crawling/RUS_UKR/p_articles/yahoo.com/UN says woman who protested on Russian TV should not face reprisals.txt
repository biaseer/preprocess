GENEVA Reuters - The United Nations human rights office called on Russian authorities on Tuesday to make sure that an anti-war protester who interrupted Channel One television is not punished for exercising her right to free speech.
The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the actions of a woman who interrupted a live news bulletin on Russia's state TV Channel One on Monday night to denounce the war in Ukraine amounted to "hooliganism".
Ravina Shamdasani, U.N. human rights spokesperson told a Geneva news briefing on Tuesday that Russian authorities should ensure that the woman "does not face any reprisals for exercising her right to freedom of expression".
