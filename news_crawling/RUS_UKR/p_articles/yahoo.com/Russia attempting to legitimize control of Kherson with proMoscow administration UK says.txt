These statements are likely indicative of Russian intent to exert strong political and economic influence in Kherson over the long term, the ministry said.
Russias invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, has killed thousands on both sides and led about 5.3 million refugees to flee the country.
The United Kingdoms defense ministry said on Sunday that Russia is attempting to legitimize its control of the Ukrainian city of Kherson by installing a pro-Moscow government.
Recent statements from this administration include declaring a return to Ukrainian control impossible and announcing a four-month currency transition from the Ukrainian hryvnia to the Russian rouble, the ministry said. The Russian rouble is due to be used in Kherson from today.
The ministry also noted in a Twitter thread that Russian forces plan to transition the citys currency to the ruble.
Enduring control over Kherson and its transport links will increase Russias ability to sustain its advance to the north and west and improve the security of Russias control over Crimea.
It added that Russia plans to implement a strong political and economic influence in the city.
British defense officials recently warned that a Russian fleet in the Black Sea can still strike Ukrainian and coastal targets despite suffering embarrassing losses in the area.
