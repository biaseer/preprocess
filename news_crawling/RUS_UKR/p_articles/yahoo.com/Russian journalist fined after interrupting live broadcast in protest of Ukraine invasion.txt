Marina Ovsyannikova has not yet been found. She has been imprisoned for more than 12 hours, Chikov said, the Telegraph reported.
The Russian Investigative Committee, the countrys main government investigative body, reportedly launched such check into Ovsyannikova on the basis that she allegedly broke into the news studio. Citing an unidentified source, Russias state-run Tass reported that she could also face charges of discrediting the actions of Russias armed forces.
In the end, the broadcast was cut off, and a pre-recorded segment was played instead. Human rights attorney Pavel Chikov in a tweet said no one, including her lawyers, had been able to get in touch with her in the wake of her protest.
The news anchor attempted to continue to speak over Ovsyannikovas shouts, but she ultimately failed to successfully drown her out and distract from the large poster.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov during a news briefing Tuesday waved off Ovsyannikovas actions as hooliganism, adding that the news network, not the Kremlin, was dealing with this.
Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at the state televisions flagship Channel 1 News, was charged with organizing an unauthorized public event and ordered to pay a 30,000 ruble fine, which is just more than $280, BBC News reported. Her appearance in the Moscow courtroom marked the first time she had been seen or heard from since she burst into the newsroom Monday evening, giant sign in hand, shouting Stop the war and No to war!
A bold Russian journalist appeared in court Tuesday, quelling fears that shed gone missing after she disrupted a live broadcast in protest of President Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine.
