Intelligence sharing also remains a focus. NBC News reported Thursday that information shared by the U.S. helped Ukraine sink the Russian cruiser Moskva.
Russia has attacked the massive steel plant, where civilians and a group of soldiers have been barricaded since mid-April. Ukraine said Wednesday it lost contact with the troops amid heavy fighting.
Civilian evacuations from the Azovstal steel plant and surrounding areas in the Russia-occupied city of Mariupol continued Thursday night into Friday, with U.N. Secretary-General Antnio Guterres announcing the safe passage of almost 500 people.
Russia maintains its offensive in eastern Ukraine, where officials have said civilian centers are still the target of strikes. U.S. and E.U. support is still entering the country, with President Joe Biden on Friday authorizing the shipment of another $150 million in military assistance for Ukraine.
