The Russian army is using anti-radar air-to-surface missiles to try to destroy positions of the Ukrainian Air Defence, but the Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively resisting.
Details: Ihnat also stated that on 6 July, the Air Defence of the Air Force of Ukraine destroyed two Kalibr cruise missiles launched by the occupiers at southern oblasts from the Black Sea area.
The combat aircraft, i.e. bombers and attack aircraft of the Air Forces of Ukraine, hit Russian positions on the East and South fronts from the air.
Quote: "The opponent keeps using anti-radar missiles of the "air-to-surface" class of the X-31P and X-58 types against anti-aircraft, rocket and radio engineering subdivisions of the Air Forces of Ukraine on different fronts to try to destroy the positions of our Air Defence. Ukrainian Air Defence is taking all counter measures so that these missiles do not hit their targets".
