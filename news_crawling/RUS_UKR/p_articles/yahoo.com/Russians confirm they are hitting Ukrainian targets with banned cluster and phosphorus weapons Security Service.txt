The Russian invaders confirm that they are using phosphorus and cluster weapons in Ukraine, which are prohibited by international conventions.
Thus, the Russian Federation continues to grossly violate the laws and customs of war, in order to destroy as many peaceful Ukrainians as possible.
The intercepts and the collected data will be included in the materials for the international courts, so that no Russian war criminal escapes punishment, the intelligence service notes.
Since 2014, the Security Service of Ukraine has repeatedly recorded the use of prohibited weapons by Russian occupiers in the area of the Anti-Terrorist Operation ZoneJoint Forces Operation. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, these war crimes have been committed by the occupiers along the entire front line. The Security Service of Ukraine documents each of them.
Quote from the occupier: "Yes, they are still waiting for Volodka Putin -ed.. To get all this fcked up, he will withdraw the troops and fcking fire "Topols" here. And so, you see, everything that was forbidden by international conventions: cluster bombs, phosphorus  we were allowed everything, we let everything go there."
