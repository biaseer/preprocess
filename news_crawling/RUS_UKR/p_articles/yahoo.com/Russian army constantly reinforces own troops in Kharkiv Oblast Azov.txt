They do understand that theyre losing their fighting capabilities, losing their personnel, so thats why the enemy is reinforcing its own positions in the north, Nemichev said, speaking of Russian forces.
However, even this still is not enabling the Russian army to expand the territories it controls, he said.
The situation in the north-eastern oblast, which has Ukraines second-biggest city, was described by Kostyantyn Nemichev, head of staff at Kraken special regiment within the Azov Regiment, during an appearance on Kyivs Espresso a television channel.
Nemichev said that his regiment has lost a substantial amount of drones in Kharkiv Oblast as Russians keep targeting them in the skies. However, Azov still does intelligence work in the skies, as it allows Ukrainian artillery to have better precision, he said.
New battalions arrive here and they try to advance. But were keeping our positions defended. If you take the Izyum area, closer to Stary Saltiv, there you have Russian troops being reinforced too. But our Armed Forces are there, defending their positions, pushing away all the attacks and then trying to do counter-offensives.
Nemichev added that Russia is regularly deploying more troops to the Izyum area, including mostly professional servicemen, while the number of forcefully drafted recruits from the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics is smaller now.
