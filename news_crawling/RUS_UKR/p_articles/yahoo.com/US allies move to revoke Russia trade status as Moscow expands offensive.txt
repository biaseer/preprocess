President Joe Biden called for revoking normal trade relations with Russia on Friday, which would pave the way for new tariffs  a move supported by both parties in Congress and joined by members of the Group of 7 nations and the European Union.
Ukraine continued to try to evacuate civilians from besieged cities, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that as many as 100,000 people had been brought to safety over the past two days.
Satellite images appeared to show that a huge military convoy close to Kyiv had dispersed, prompting fears of an imminent ground offensive. Multiple airstrikes also hit the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk early Friday, Ukraine's Parliament said, striking farther west than before.
Meanwhile, Russian forces appeared to be stepping up their campaign across Ukraine, edging closer to the capital, Kyiv, and expanding their offensive west.
