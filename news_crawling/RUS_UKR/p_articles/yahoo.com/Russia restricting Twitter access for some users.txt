In addition, western nations including the U.S., Canada and members of the EU have posted updates on military assistance they are sending to Ukraine.
The news from Twitter follows an announcement Friday from Russian-owned media that it is partially restricting Facebook.
Facebook also said Thursday that it is launching a Special Operations Center to monitor the war in Ukraine.
Twitter announced Saturday that Russia appeared to be restricting access to its platform amid ongoing conflict between the Russian military and Ukrainian forces.
Twitter Support tweeted Saturday: "We're aware that Twitter is being restricted for some people in Russia and are working to keep our service safe and accessible."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian government officials have used the platform to rebut false claims from Russia and update the international community about the war in his country.
Following the Russian invasion Thursday morning, video surfaced on Twitter of demonstrators in major Russian cities taking to the streets to speak out against war with the former Soviet state.
State-owned news outlet RIA Novosti claimed that Facebook is censoring its content, and subsequently accused Facebook of being "involved in the violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms."
Facebook created a new feature in Ukraine allowing Ukrainian users to lock their profiles for security reasons amid the invasion.
