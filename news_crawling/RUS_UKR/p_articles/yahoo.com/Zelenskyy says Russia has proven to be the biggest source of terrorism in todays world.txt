Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for Russia to be recognized as a terrorist state after attacks in separatist Donetskkilled dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war.
"Every occupier, who abuses Ukrainians, who tortures and kills, should know that there will be punishment for this. If some of the Russian killers hope that they will not be brought to justice, that they will hide somewhere, let them know: they will be held accountable in any case. Geography, time, borders and walls will not stop a just retribution," Zelenskyy said on Telegram.
"The occupiers' attack on Olenivka is a deliberate war crime by the Russians, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war," Zelenskyy said. "There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a terrorist state. Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in today's world."
