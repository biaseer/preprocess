"As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history," a statement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Twitter reads. "Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks."
Russian troops launched an attack on Ukraine on Thursday, with explosions and setting off air raid sirens in Kyiv, among other cities, causing residents to flee.
"Russia must immediately cease all hostile actions against Ukraine and withdraw all military and proxy forces from the country."
In a public addrss, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that countries that interfere is Russia's actions will result in "consequences they have never seen."
Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine, saying the Ukrainians woke up to "the brutal, terrifying reality of war" in the "greatest threat to European stability since World War II."
"Make no mistake, Russias attack on Ukraine is also an attack on democracy, on international law, on human rights and on freedom," Trudeau said. "Democracies and democratic leader everywhere must come together to defend these principals and stand firmly against authoritarianism."
