A Russian occupier told a compatriot of his on the phone that after fighting in Kharkiv Oblast, only 6 occupiers remain out of 80 troops in his unit.
Quote: "Yesterday they went on the offensive. I looked at the plan and I said, guys, well, fk you. Im not going with you. Youll be fked over.
Background: On 15 June the Chief Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence published an intercepted telephone conversation in which an occupier explains to his wife that he may die unless they are taken out of Ukrainian territory very soon.
I was already thinking of cutting and running. We dont get time off, for fks sake. Like, theres an offensive, what time off? Like, they dont pay the money, no one can substitute. And theyve just chucked us here like cannon fodder About eighty people have already fked off. Theres about six of us left."
Details: From the occupier's conversation, it is clear that the Russian military command is deliberately leaving wounded soldiers to die on the battlefield, even if they ask to be evacuated.
