National Unity Day is a public holiday created by Putins administration in 2004 to replace the Communist October Revolution Day, when tanks, missiles and troops used to parade through Moscows Red Square.
Crimes seizure drew international condemnation and sanctions against Moscow, but provided a significant boost to Putins domestic popularity and he has angered Ukraine with a series of visits in the past seven years.
MOSCOWKYIV Reuters      President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russias National Unity Day on Thursday with a visit to annexed Crimea, drawing a sharp protest from Ukraine.
Speaking in Sevastopol, home to the Russian Black Sea fleet,  Putin said the city and Crimea are now forever with Russia.
