At the moment, these missiles are more useful for Estonias security in defence of Ukraine rather than at a live fire exercise on an Estonian training area, Lieutenant General Martin Herem, Commander of Estonian Defence Forces, said in a  statement.
This is a small step by Estonia in support of Ukraine, but it is a real and tangible contribution to defence against Russian aggression.
VILNIUS Reuters      Estonia delivered Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine on Friday, the Estonian Defence Ministry said.
