Writing on Telegram, Ovsyannikovas lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said that a criminal case had been opened against her under Russias law criminalising the spreading of fake information about the Russian army.
Ukraine-born Ovsyannikova rose to prominence when the then editor on Russias flagship Channel One mounted a protest against the conflict in Ukraine on a nightly news broadcast.
She has since been arrested and fined for her continued opposition to Russias military campaign in Ukraine several times.
Reuters      Russian state security services on Wednesday searched the house of former state TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, who in March denounced the war in Ukraine during a live news bulletin on television, her lawyer said on social media.
