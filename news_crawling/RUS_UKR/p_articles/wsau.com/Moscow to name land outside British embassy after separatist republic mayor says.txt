Moscow on Sunday claimed the liberation of the entire LPR on the territory of Ukraines Luhansk province, and is pressing on with its campaign to wrest the adjoining DPR  Ukraines Donetsk province  out of Kyivs control.
MOSCOW Reuters      A strip of land outside the British Embassy in Moscow will be named after the self-proclaimed separatist Luhansk Peoples Republic LPR in eastern Ukraine following an online poll, the city administration said in a statement on its website.
The United States and Britain have been among the biggest critics of Russias actions in Ukraine, dismissing the  allegations of persecution as a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression.
Russia recognised the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic DPR and LPR as independent shortly before sending its armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24, saying it had to defend the Russian-speakers of eastern Ukraine from persecution by Kyiv. Ukraine denies the accusation of persecution.
Last month, an intersection near the U.S. embassy was named Donetsk Peoples Republic Square after another Russian-backed breakaway state in Ukraine, also recognised only by Russia and Syria.
City councillors had initially proposed the name Defenders of Donbas Square  which the Embassy jokingly welcomed as a tribute to Ukrainian soldiers fighting Russian aggression.
