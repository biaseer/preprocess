The agribusiness and processing businesses were on track to deliver record financial results, the company said, adding its supply chains were operating at close to full capacity to export grains.
Reuters -Australias Graincorp on Wednesday raised its annual profit forecast for the second time, as the agribusiness firm continues to reap the benefits of a supply crunch from the war in Ukraine, aided by expectations of above-average East Coast Australian ECA crop.
Graincorp sees above-average ECA crop in year 202223, which, combined with a favourable three-month rainfall outlook, sets the company up for an upbeat fiscal 2022.
Australia, the worlds sixth-largest wheat exporter, is set to ship a record volume this year as buyers look for suppliers to replace cargoes from Russia and Ukraine.
The company said it now expects fiscal 2022 underlying net profit after tax to be A$365 million $254.08 million to A$400 million, compared with its earlier forecast of A$310 million to A$370 million, up significantly from A$139 million reported last year.
