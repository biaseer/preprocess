Russian missiles struck airports, military positions and cities across Ukraine, including the capital of Kyiv, early Thursday as Vladimir Putin launched the most dangerous phase of his eight-year war.
In a statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his nation suffered strikes on military and other important defense facilities, adding that border units are under attack, the situation in the Donbas has degraded.
Witnesses and reporters heard blasts from Kharkiv in the east to Kyiv in the north to Odessa in the south, signaling Russians sights are set far beyond the Donbas region.
