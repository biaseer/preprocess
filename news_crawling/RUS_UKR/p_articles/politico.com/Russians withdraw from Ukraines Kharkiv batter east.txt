Ukraines general staff said the Russians were pulling back from the northeastern city of Kharkiv and focusing on guarding supply routes, while launching mortar, artillery and airstrikes in the eastern Donetsk province in order to deplete Ukrainian forces and destroy fortifications.
Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine was entering a new - long-term - phase of the war.
