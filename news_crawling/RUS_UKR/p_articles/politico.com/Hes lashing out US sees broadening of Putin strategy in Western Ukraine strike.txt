At least 35 people died and 130 were injured in the attack targeting the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security in northwestern Lviv near the Polish border, according to the Associated Press.
The strike was in contrast to Russias previous assaults, which targeted mostly the eastern and southern areas of Ukraine. The deputy mayor of Lviv, Andriy Moskalenko, speaking on CBSs Face the Nation said the air strikes were like a new edge in this war.
National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday said an early morning Russian missile strike in western Ukraine just 11 miles from NATO territory does not come as a surprise but could present a turning point in the Kremlins strategy.
