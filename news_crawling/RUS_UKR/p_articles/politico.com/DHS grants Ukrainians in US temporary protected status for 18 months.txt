The Department of Homeland Security announced on Thursday that it was granting temporary protected status to Ukrainians in the United States for 18 months.
Russias premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.
