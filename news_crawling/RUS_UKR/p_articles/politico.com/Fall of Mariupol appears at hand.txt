KYIV, Ukraine  Mariupol appeared on the verge of falling to the Russians on Tuesday as Ukraine moved to abandon the steel plant where hundreds of its fighters had held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city.
More than 260 Ukrainian fighters  some of them seriously wounded and taken out on stretchers  left the ruins of the Azovstal plant on Monday and turned themselves over to the Russian side in a deal negotiated by the warring parties. An additional seven buses carrying an unknown number of Ukrainian soldiers from the plant were seen arriving at a former penal colony Tuesday in the town of Olenivka, approximately 88 kilometers 55 miles north of Mariupol.
The capture of Mariupol would make it the biggest city to be taken by Moscows forces and would give the Kremlin a badly needed victory, though the landscape has largely been reduced to rubble.
