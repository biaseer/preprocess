National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the United States is committed to providing weapons and military supplies to the Ukraine military as it continues to defend against attacks from Russia.
Moscow has warned Washington it would see the deliveries of Western weapons to Ukraine as targets.
We believe in our capacity to continue to flow substantial amounts of military assistance, weapons and supplies to the front in Ukraine, Sullivan said on CBSs Face the Nation.
