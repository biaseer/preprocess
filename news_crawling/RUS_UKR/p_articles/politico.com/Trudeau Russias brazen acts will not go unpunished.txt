OTTAWA, Ont.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned Russias widespread invasion of Ukraine, warning that Canada and its G-7 allies will meet Thursday morning to discuss hitting back with severe sanctions.
Trudeaus statement came a couple of hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation against Ukraine. Following Putins speech, explosions were reported throughout Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv.

In the face of these attacks on Ukraine, Canada will take additional action to stop Russias unwarranted aggression, Trudeau said late Wednesday. Russias brazen acts will not go unpunished.
