It wasnt immediately clear where exactly the troops that the Russian Defense Ministry said were pulling back were deployed or how many were leaving, making it hard to understand the significance. The announcement pushed world markets and the ruble up, but Ukraines leaders expressed skepticism.
The announcement came a day after Russias foreign minister indicated the country was ready to keep talking about the security grievances that led to the Ukraine crisis  changing the tenor after weeks of rising tensions. Still, Western officials continued to warn that an invasion could come at any moment and said some forces and military hardware were moving toward the border, muddying the picture.
