But U.S. officials also cant independently confirm Russias claim, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Its not entirely clear, so what we would assess is its certainly possible.

Russia may have launched a hypersonic missile over the weekend in an assault on a Ukrainian munitions depot, a senior Defense Department official said Monday, but Moscows claim about the nature of the weapon is a bit of a head-scratcher.
U.S. officials are not able to refute the Russian militarys declaration Saturday that it used a Kinzhal hypersonic missile to strike an underground warehouse storing Ukrainian missiles and aviation ammunition, the official said. The launch would be the first use of the Kinzhal in combat.
