The war in Ukraine will end in some form. The longer it persists, the higher the costs to both Ukraine and Russia. Clearly a diplomatic solution is preferable, but it is difficult to identify a diplomatic construct that could provide a sufficient and face-saving off-ramp for Russia as well as the kind of security that Ukraine needs.
If there is an acceptable diplomatic formula to end this war, it would need to involve some secure form of Ukrainian neutrality and an open path for Ukraine toward its democratic and economic aspirations in the European Union.
The center of gravity of any negotiated settlement to this war will be the question of Ukraines status between the Western alliance and Russia. Russia will insist on a neutral Ukraine, not part of any military alliance that could conceivably threaten Russia. Ukraine, on the other hand, cannot possibly agree simply to declare itself neutral, at the mercy of its neighbor, as Russia demands.
