Vekselberg had been sanctioned by the United States since 2018 and the Department of Justice alleged Monday that Tango was also in violation of U.S. bank fraud and money laundering statutes. The seizure is the first action carried out by the U.S. governments interagency KleptoCapture task force, created last month as part of an elevated effort to enforce sanctions.
U.S. and Spanish authorities conducted an operation on Monday to capture the superyacht of a U.S.-sanctioned Russian oligarch, marking the first U.S.-involved yacht seizure since penalties against Russias elite class were announced in retaliation for Moscows invasion of Ukraine.
The seized vessel is Tango, a 254-foot luxury yacht that was docked in Spain and is estimated by the U.S. government to cost $90 million. The Department of Justice said Monday that the yacht is owned by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, an energy and metal tycoon and member of Russian President Vladimir Putins inner circle. The yacht was seized in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for assistance in the execution of a seizure warrant issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
