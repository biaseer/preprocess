Austrias chancellor said he believes President Vladimir Putin is stuck in his own war logic.
Speaking about his meeting last week with Putin, Chancellor Karl Nehammer told NBCs Chuck Todd, I think he is now in his own war logic, you know? He thinks the war is necessary for security guarantees for the Russian Federation. He doesnt trust the international community. He blames Ukrainians for genocides in the Donbas region.
Nehammer, whose interview was to air Sunday on Meet the Press, also said Putin is of the belief that Russia is winning the war against Ukraine.
