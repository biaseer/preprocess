Mariupol had been the target of Russian forces in 2014 when President Vladimir Putin first invaded, using special forces and separatist proxies to occupy a swathe of territory the size of New Jersey. It saw some fighting on the streets then and was struck by a devastating missile barrage in January 2015. But in the years since, Mariupol had been largely out of firing range, as the hot phase of the war gave way to a grinding battle of attrition. Residents had grown relatively comfortable living adjacent to a static frontline. We shrugged our shoulders, so to speak, Oksana said.
KYIV  Oksana was just finishing her coffee on the morning of Feb. 24, when the bombs started raining down on Mariupol.
She had heard the rumors about a potential Russian invasion. But everyone thought it was just some kind of panic. We didnt understand how dangerous it was, she said. For the past eight years we have listened to the distant sounds of shooting and we understood that we were at war already.
