The deliberate targeting of innocent people is beyond comprehension and as a council and a city we condemn this. Leeds is a welcoming and compassionate city and we will work with our Ukrainian friends and partners in communities across the city to provide the necessary support and reassurance that may be needed.
We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues. The ability to comment on our stories is a privilege, not a right, however, and that privilege may be withdrawn if it is abused or misused.
In a statement on Putin's invasion Cllr James Lewis said: On behalf of Leeds City Council and the city of Leeds I want to express how deeply saddened and shocked we are by the situation in Ukraine. Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and with those Ukrainians who already call Leeds their home.
THE RUSSIAN attacks on Ukraine have been condemned by the Leader of Leeds City Council.
