KYIV, Aug 15 Reuters - The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, who was a member of a pro-Russian opposition political party, was found dead in his house with a gunshot wound on Sunday.
Pictures posted on social media by Pavlov's fellow party member, Vadim Rabinovich, showed the mayor lying on the floor at the entrance to his residence, with a gun next to his left leg.
Artem Marchevsky, general producer of 112 Ukraine TV channel and also a member of the pro-Russian Opposition Platform - For Life party, said Pavlov was found with a gunshot wound to the head.
It was unclear whether Konstantin Pavlov's death was a murder or suicide. The National Police of Ukraine said it was establishing the circumstances of the death and had opened a criminal case.
Pavlov, 48, is a member of the Opposition Platform - For Life party. He was elected mayor of Kryvyi Rih, a city in central Ukraine which is also the hometown of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, last December.
