Portman says the senate will be working on an aid package this week for Ukraine, which include sanctions against Russia, military aid, and help against cyber-attacks.
This is about the fight for freedom, says Portman. This is a country that has decided that they want to be like us. They want to be a democracy. They want to respect the rule of law. They want to have a free enterprise system that's strong and vibrant. This has all happened in the last eight years and they have turned to the EU and turned to the United States and said, we want to be part of the West.
The situation in the Ukraine continues to grow more tense, and an Ohio Senator says that the United States needs to be ready for Russias next move. Senator Rob Portman was on Meet the Press Sunday morning talking about escalating crisis between Ukraine and Russia. President Vladimir Putin has thousands of troops on the border and the pentagon says he could invade at any time. Portman went to the Ukraine a couple of weeks ago to talk to their president about the ongoing threat and why he believes that the United States should get involved.
