Over $2 billion worth of work is coming to the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. President Joe Biden signed the $770 billion 2022 National Defense Authorization Act into law. The funding bill included nearly $1.4 billion for Abrams tank upgrades and $1.1 billion for Stryker vehicle work and another $331 million to build the Stryker chassis for the short-range air defense vehicle. Senator Rob Portman says the funding is important to the workers here in Lima and to the troops in the field. The NDAA also includes a pay raise for active military and support for the Ukraine which is under threat by Russia.
