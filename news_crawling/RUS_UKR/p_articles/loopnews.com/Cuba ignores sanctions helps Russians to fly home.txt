In addition toAeroflot, Nordwind Airlineswill also reportedly participate in the evacuation operations for Russian touristsfrom the Juan Gualberto Gmez airports in Varaderoand Jardines del Rey, in Cayo Coco, Cuba.
Other sources reportingCuban news also carried the story, saying that a Russian owned airline, Aeroflot,facilitated the journey for the 300 Russians, who were apparently Russians visiting Cuba and stranded there because of the EU sanctions.
The events in Cuba were confirmed by a tweet from the Russian Embassy in Cuba on March 5, which indicated that300 Russians were awarded safe travel from Cuba to their homeland.
In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the European Union EU recently imposed a number of sanctions on Russia, including the prohibition of Russian airlines from usingEU airspace. Cuba, on the other hand, is permitting Russian airplanes to land in Cuba and is assisting with the repatriation of Russians to Russia.
In terms of the impact that Cuba is making, the evacuations from Cuba represent a small number of the approximately 18,000 Russians who are said to be stranded in the Caribbean because of the EU sanctions.
