Last week, Ukraine summoned the top papal diplomat to complain about recent comments by Francis.
Francis was speaking about Darya Dugina, the daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin, who fiercely backs the war.
At an audience a day earlier at the Vatican, Francis had referred to a national Russian TV commentator who was killed by a car bomb in Moscow as a poor girl.
Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba summoned the Vatican ambassador to Kyiv last week and told reporters that the Ukrainian heart is torn apart by the Popes words.
Francis has said he wants to go to Ukraine if it could further the cause of peace but logistics have made the trip impossible for the 85-year-old pontiff who has mobility issues.
The words of the Holy Father on this dramatic question should be read as a voice raised in defence of human life and of the values linked to that, and not taken as a political position, the Vatican said.
In his remarks, Francis also said orphans in Ukraine and Russia were among the innocents victimised by the insanity of war.
On the day Ukraine condemned the Popes remarks, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church cancelled a meeting with him planned for September.
In a statement on Tuesday the Vatican said: In recent days, public discussions have arisen about the political significance to attribute to comments by Francis.
As for the war of wide dimensions in Ukraine, begun by the Russian Federation, the interventions of the Holy Father Francis are clear and unequivocal in condemning it as morally unjust, unacceptable, barbaric, senseless, repugnant and sacrilegious.
