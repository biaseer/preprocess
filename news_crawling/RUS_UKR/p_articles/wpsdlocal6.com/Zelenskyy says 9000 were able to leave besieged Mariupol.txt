Zelenskyy then asked his audience to picture the stadium filled with the thousands of Russians who have been killed, wounded or maimed in the fighting.

LVIV, Ukraine AP Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russian forces are blockading Ukraine's largest cities to create a humanitarian catastrophe with the aim of persuading Ukrainians to cooperate with them.
He said more than 9,000 people were able to leave besieged Mariupol in the past day, and in all more than 180,000 people have been able to flee to safety through humanitarian corridors.
This is a totally deliberate tactic, Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation, filmed outside in Kyiv, with the presidential office in the lamplight behind him.
This photo shows a theater in Mariupol, Ukraine, that was bombed on March 16. Around 130 people have reportedly been rescued from the theater.
He again appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold talks with him directly. Its time to meet, time to speak, he said. I want to be heard by everyone, especially in Moscow.
He says Russians are preventing supplies from reaching surrounded cities in the center and southeast of the country.
