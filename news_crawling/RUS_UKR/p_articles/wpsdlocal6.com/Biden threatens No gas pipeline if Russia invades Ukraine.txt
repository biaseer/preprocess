WASHINGTON AP  In a flurry of diplomacy across two continents, Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin have met separately for hours with the leaders of Germany and France.
The biggest news Monday: Biden's vow that Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Europe will be blocked if Russia further invades Ukraine.
They are trying to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, where Russia has massed thousands of troops at the border.
Putin objected anew that the U.S. and NATO won't guarantee to keep Ukraine out of the alliance, which he sees as a threat to Russia.
