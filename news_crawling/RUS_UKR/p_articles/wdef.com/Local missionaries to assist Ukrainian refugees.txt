But what they do know is that they have the chance to make a difference.
Victoria still has family in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, including her mother, grandparents, brother and more.
Maybe, you know, two people cant do too much it seems, but we can help some of them, Benach said. We can go to Poland and meet refugees and just make a difference for somebodys life.
After praying to the Good Lord for the chance to make a difference, the couples prayers have finally been answered.
Graysville, GA WDEF  Dr. Henry Benach has been to Ukraine for more than 70 missionary trips.
Theyre looking right now for people who care for them, who are going to help them in any way. Dr. Benach said. So, Im not sure whats going to happen. I know that weve been directed to go there. Ive booked the tickets, got everything ready and were going by faith.
I heard a story about a man walking on the beach and there were seashells and starfish on the beach, Dr. Benach said. There were thousands of them. Another man was walking along and he was reaching down and was picking up the starfish and throwing them into the water. The other man said to him, What are you doing? You cant save all these starfish. He says, No, but I can make a difference in this ones life.'
Even if they can help just one person, they agreed thats more than enough of a reason to go.
Henrys last effort to reach Ukraine ended in Istanbul, Turkey, when no air service was available into the country.
After praying on it, the missionary couple will finally, personally provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in Poland.
Henry plans to provide simple pleasures like candy to children in need of a smile, while Victoria wants to be a shoulder to cry on for refugee women.
Once in Poland, the Benachs plan to share the Gospel with all they can find.
