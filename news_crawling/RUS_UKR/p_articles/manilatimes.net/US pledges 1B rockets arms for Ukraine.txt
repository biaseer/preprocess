WASHINGTON, D.C.: United States President Joe Biden's administration said on Monday Tuesday in Manila it was shipping its biggest direct delivery of weapons so far to Ukraine as that country prepares for a potentially decisive counteroffensive in the south against Russia, sending $1 billion in rockets, ammunition and other material to Kyiv from US Defense Department stockpiles.
