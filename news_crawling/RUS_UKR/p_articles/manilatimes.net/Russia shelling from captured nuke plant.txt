KYIV: Russia is using Europe's largest nuclear power plant as a base to store weapons, including "missile systems," and shell surrounding areas in Ukraine, the chief of Kyiv's nuclear agency said on Friday, while nearly the entire country was placed on air raid alert.
Petro Kotin, president of the Ukrainian nuclear agency Energoatom, said the situation at the plant in the city of Zaporizhzhia was "extremely tense," with up to 500 Russian soldiers controlling the facility.
