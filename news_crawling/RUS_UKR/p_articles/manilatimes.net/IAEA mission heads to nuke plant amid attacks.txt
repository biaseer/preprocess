KYIV: A convoy of jeeps carrying United Nations atomic inspectors was crossing Ukraine early on Wednesday toward the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, holding the world's hope that it could help secure the safety of the facility in the middle of a war zone and avoid any nuclear catastrophe.
Yet ominously, the Moscow-backed local authorities in Zaporizhzhia claimed Ukrainian forces shelled the territory of the plant and the nearby town of Enerhodar overnight. Both sides have accused each other of bombing the wider area for weeks now, increasing fears of an accident or radiation leak.
