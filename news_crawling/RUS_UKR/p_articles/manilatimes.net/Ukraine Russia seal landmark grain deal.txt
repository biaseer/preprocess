ISTANBUL: Ukraine and Russia signed on Friday a landmark agreement aimed at relieving a global food crisis caused by blocked Black Sea grain deliveries, ending months of negotiations and sending wheat prices tumbling to levels last seen before Moscow's invasion of its pro-West neighbor.The first major deal between the warring parties since the invasion's launch on February 24 should help ease the "acute hunger" that the United Nations says faces an additional 47 million people because of the war.
The hostility between Moscow and Kyiv spilled over into the signing ceremony  delayed briefly by disputes about the display of flags around the table and Ukraine's refusal to put its name on the same document as the Russians.
