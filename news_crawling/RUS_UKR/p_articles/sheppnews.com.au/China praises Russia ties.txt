China's Red Cross will provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine "as soon as possible", Foreign Minister Wang Yi says, as he praised his country's friendship with Russia as "rock solid".
"Solving complex problems requires calmness and rationality, rather than adding fuel to the fire and intensifying contradictions," he told a news conference on Monday on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's parliament.
"No matter how sinister the international situation is, both China and Russia will maintain their strategic determination and continuously push forward the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in the new era."
Wang said the causes of the "Ukraine situation" were "complex" and had not happened overnight.
China is willing to continue to make its own efforts to resolve the humanitarian crisis and the country's Red Cross will "as soon as possible" provide a batch of aid to Ukraine, Wang said, without giving details.
Russian President Vladimir Putin met Chinese President Xi Jinping  hours before the start of last month's Winter Olympics in Beijing and they signed a wide-ranging strategic partnership aimed at countering US influence and said they would have "no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation".
China has refused to condemn Russia's attack on Ukraine or call it an invasion while asking Western countries to respect Russia's "legitimate security concerns."
Wang said the friendship between China and Russia was "rock solid" and prospects for cooperation bright.
