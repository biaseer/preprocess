An amateur video said to have been taken in Donetsk showed heavy damage to shops and vehicles. The footage cannot be independently verified and the Ukrainian government has not commented so far.
At least 20 people have been killed and nine injured by fragments of a Ukrainian missile in the eastern city of Donetsk, according to pro-Russian separatists in the area.
The Tochka-U missile was intercepted over the rebel stronghold but parts of it fell in the city centre, Russia's TASS news agency reported citing local separatist leader Denis Pushilin.
