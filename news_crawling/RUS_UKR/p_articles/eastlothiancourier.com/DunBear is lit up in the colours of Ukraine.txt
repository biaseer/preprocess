We wanted the people of Ukraine to know the considerable support they have, given the horrific impact of the Russian invasion, which has torn so many lives apart.
We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues. The ability to comment on our stories is a privilege, not a right, however, and that privilege may be withdrawn if it is abused or misused.
Ken Ross, from Hallhill Developments, which is responsible for The DunBear and is undertaking the neighbouring DunBear Park development, said: As part of the global show of solidarity for the people of Ukraine, we have lit up the stunning DunBear sculpture in blue and yellow, the colours of the Ukraine flag.
A tribute to the pioneering Dunbar-born naturalist and conservationist John Muir, who played a key role in the establishment of national parks in the USA, the steel sculpture is much-loved by the community and has attracted increased footfall to the town.
A FIVE-METRE sculpture of a bear on the outskirts of Dunbar is basking in a blue and yellow glow in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.
The DunBear, created by renowned Scottish sculptor Andy Scott, has proven a popular attraction since it was unveiled in 2019.
