An assault on Ukraine is an assault on democracy, the California Democrat told ABCs This Week. The loss of life, the damage, the collateral damage to civilians, to military and the rest are severe if he decides to invade.
If he decides to invade, the mothers in Russia dont like their children going into what hes had to experience the  forgive the expression  body bags from the moms before, so he has to know that war is not an answer, Pelosi said. Theres very severe consequences to his aggression, and we are united in using them.
About 130,000 Russian troops are gathered there, prompting fears of an imminent invasion, though Russias strongman President Vladimir Putin insists he has no such plans. Hes been calling for assurances that Ukraine, a former member of the USSR, will never join NATO, among other measures.
The comments came as Russian forces continued to do drills and maneuvers near the border with Ukraine through the weekend.
A Russian invasion of Ukraine would mark not just a violation of the Eastern European countrys sovereignty, but an attack on democracy as a whole, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday.
