Sullivan also voiced concern that Russian forces, which launched their unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, could use chemical weapons.

The United States will work with our allies to defend every inch of NATO territory, and that means every inch, he told CBS Face the Nation. And if there is a military attack on NATO territory, it would cause the invocation of Article 5, and we would bring the full force of the NATO alliance to bear in responding to it.
Under Article 5 of NATOs founding treaty, members are required to come to the defense of another member if it is attacked. The alliance has 30 member countries.
There is an escalating level of rhetoric on the Russian side trying to accuse the Ukrainians and the United States of potentially using chemical or biological weapons, he said. And thats a tell.
Thats an indicator that in fact, the Russians are getting ready to do it and try and pin the blame elsewhere, and nobody should fall for that.
As Russian troops attacked western Ukraine, just miles from the Polish border, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said NATO would respond to an intentional or accidental attack on one of its members.
If Russia attacks a NATO member country during its invasion of Ukraine, the military alliance will respond with full force, a top White House official said Sunday.
