Putin will never gain the hearts and minds of the Iranian people, conservative commentator Ann Coulter repeated on Twitter. Thats a relief.
Even with the teleprompter running, and the correct words scrolling before him, President Biden went off script making a blunder that had social media wondering what map he was looking at.
In a blistering attack on Russia and its bully president, Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin had isolated himself with his unprovoked attack on Ukraine.
He referenced Iranian people, another Twitter user wrote.. Maybe he meant Ukrainian. Or maybe not.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, Biden said Tuesday night in his State of the Union address. But he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people. He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.
