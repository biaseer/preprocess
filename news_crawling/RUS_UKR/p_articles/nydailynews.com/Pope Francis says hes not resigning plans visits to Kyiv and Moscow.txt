Troubled by knee pain and a host of other ailments, Pope Francis insisted that hes not resigning and that the only place hes going is to Canada, followed by war-torn Eastern Europe.
The Argentine natives papacy began in March 2013. He succeeded Pope Benedict XVI, who was the first pope to resign the position in nearly 700 years.
He said his recovery is slowly coming along thanks to a regimen that includes laser and magnet therapy.
He started using a wheelchair two months ago as he was having difficulty walking and standing for long. His knee issues are the latest in a series of health ailments hes suffered. He underwent surgery last year to remove part of his colon, an operation that kept him hospitalized for 10 days. This year, he sat out Ash Wednesday celebrations in March and has conducted Mass while seated.
According to the religious leader, he injured himself while stepping awkwardly when his knee was inflamed.
The pope, who used a wheelchair during his recovery, postponed planned trips to South Sudan and Congo this week based on doctors orders.
The 85-year-old pontiff said in an interview Monday that despite being hobbled by a small fracture in his knee for the past month or so, he plans to visit Canada for a week beginning on July 24, then hopes to travel to Kyiv and Moscow amid ongoing fighting between Ukraine and Russia.
