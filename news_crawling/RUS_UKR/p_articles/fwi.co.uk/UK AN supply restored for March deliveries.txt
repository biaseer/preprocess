High gas prices in the autumn led to a plant shutdown, which caused fears of carbon dioxide shortages and halted AN production. Following this the government stepped in with a short-term subsidy to maintain carbon dioxide production at the CF Billingham plant.
This is leading to speculation that plants may have to be shut down to preserve gas supply for other uses.

This puts the product in a narrow range from 650t delivered  about 5t up on the last January price. Orders are being accepted on normal payment terms and at full load prices for 21t upwards, with no apparent tonnage limits, said traders.
The new CF Fertilisers terms were put out shortly in advance of an announcement by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy that a deal had been agreed between the company and its customers that would allow carbon dioxide production to continue until the spring.
UK ammonium nitrate AN is available for March delivery, after CF Fertilisers released terms to the trade.
Added to this, Russia has imposed restrictions on AN exports, and while not much Russian product reaches the UK, the measure tightens supply generally.
There is uncertainty on AN supply from outside the UK, as political tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue and there is talk of sanctions against Russia, whose gas fuels European fertiliser plants.
Carbon dioxide is a by-product of the ammonia production process, with CF Fertilisers producing about 60 of UK food and manufacturing carbon dioxide requirements.
Meanwhile, urea prices have softened, as there are unsold cargoes looking for homes, and early this week product was available at between 725t and 740t delivered.
