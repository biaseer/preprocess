Moscow calls its actions since Feb. 24 a special military operation to disarm Ukraine and rid it of what it calls anti-Russian nationalism fomented by the West. Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
GENEVA Reuters  Members of the World Health Organizations European region passed a resolution on Tuesday that could result in the closure of Russias regional office and the suspension of meetings in the country in response to its invasion of Ukraine.
The special session of the European region passed the resolution, supported by Ukraine and the European Union, with 43 in favour and 3 against Russia, Belarus, Tajikistan and 2 abstentions.
We believe this is a huge moment of harm for the system of global healthcare, he told the meeting of members and top WHO officials.
Some have criticised the WHO resolution, saying it does not go far enough. Diplomats told Reuters they had dropped efforts to suspend Russia from the WHO executive board due to legal technicalities, although members could seek to freeze Russias voting rights at a major meeting https:apps.who.intgbeewha75.html later this month.
Backers consider it an important political step to isolate Moscow and said they were at pains to avoid any major impact on Russias health system. The resolution referred to a health emergency in Ukraine, referring to mass casualties as well as risks of chronic and infectious diseases that have resulted from Russias military actions.
