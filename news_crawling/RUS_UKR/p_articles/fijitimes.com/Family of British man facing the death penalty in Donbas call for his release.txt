Shaun should be accorded all the rights of a prisoner of war according to the Geneva Convention and including full independent legal representation. We sincerely hope that all parties will co-operate urgently to ensure the safe release or exchange of Shaun.
Our family including his son and Ukrainian wife, love and miss him so much and our hearts go out to all the families involved in this awful situation, the statement said.
Pinners family said the proceedings were an illegal show- trial and said he needed access to independent legal advice.
Firstly, our whole family is devastated and saddened at the outcome of the illegal show trial by the so-called Donetsk Peoples Republic, the family said in a statement.
Britain has called the courts decision a sham judgment and condemned Russian proxy authorities in Donbas for what it called an egregious breach of the Geneva convention.
Two Britons, Pinner and Aiden Aslin, were convicted of mercenary activities by a court on Thursday in the self-proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic, which is not recognised internationally.
LONDON Reuters  The family of British man Shaun Pinner who has been sentenced to death by a court by Russian proxy authorities in Donbas have spoken of their devastation at the news and requested he is exchanged or released.
The two men were captured during the battle for the port city of Mariupol, one of the bloodiest of the conflict that broke out when Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February.
Pinners family said he was a legitimate member of the Ukrainian army after being resident in the country for the last four years years.
