Speaking at the budget consultations in Lautoka, Economy Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said while the Government could control the price of items within Fiji, global prices caused by the conflict were uncontrollable.
The minister said the prices of gas and fuel would be most affected by the conflict.
That part of Europe, theres a lot of fuel and gas that comes from there.
Mr Sayed-Khaium said it was important for people to understand where the country was economically and what needed to be done in light of the war between the two European countries.
The war between Russia and Ukraine will continue to impact the price of things in Fiji.
So, if the supply of gas stops in Europe, therell be less gas available in the world.
So, places like Qatar, where theres gas, will certainly have a lot more demand, so the gas price will go up globally. The cooking gas price will go up.
We cant control what is happening outside of the country but we can try to control whats happening in the country.
So, we will also be looking at ways as to how we can do other things in the budget to ensure that the cost of things is maintained at a particular price, Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said.
But please remember, as weve said, the price of things will continue to go up over the next six months to one year because as you know theres a war in Ukraine.
