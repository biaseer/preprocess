Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a special operation to demilitarise and denazify the country. Ukraine and the West have dismissed that justification as baseless propaganda.
Canada, like many other Western nations, has imposed broad sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. It has also closed its airspace and ports to Russian vessels, sent lethal military aid to Ukraine and asked the International Criminal Court to probe alleged war crimes by Russian forces.
President Putin made the choice to further his illegal and unjustifiable invasion, and he can also make the choice to end it by immediately ending the senseless violence and withdrawing his forces, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said.
The new sanctions were announced ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiys expected virtual address to the Canadian parliament at 11:15 am 1515 GMT.
Canada will not hesitate to take further action should the Russian leadership fail to change course, Joly said in a statement.
Reuters  Canada said on Tuesday it was imposing sanctions on 15 Russian officials who enabled and supported President Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine to apply additional pressure on Moscow to reverse course.
