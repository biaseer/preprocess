I unequivocally condemn Russias further invasion of Ukraine  an appalling and illegal assault on a sovereign nation and democracy itself.
This is a dark and dangerous moment. The U.S. and our European allies must send Putin an unmistakable message by swiftly enacting crippling sanctions to hold Russia accountable.
LANSING, MI WKZO AMFM  Michigans U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow Thursday morning released the following statement on Russias invasion of Ukraine:
My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine, who are victims of this unprovoked war, and I stand with the American people  including the more than 39,000 Michiganders of Ukrainian descent  in opposing this aggression.
Michigans other U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Ukrainian Caucus, released the following statement after Russian President Putins declaration of war and Russias further invasion of Ukraine:
NATO must stand united and resolute in our support for the Ukrainian people. I remain committed to working with the Biden Administration and my colleagues to do our part.
I share the horror of the many Ukrainian-Americans in Michigan of this brutal, unprovoked,and unjustifiedattack by President Putin on the people of Ukraine. America will stand strong with all of our allies to do everything we can to protect their freedom and independence and save lives.
