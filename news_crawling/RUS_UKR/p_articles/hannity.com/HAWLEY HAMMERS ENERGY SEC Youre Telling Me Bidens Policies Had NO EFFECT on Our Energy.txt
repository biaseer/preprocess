Granholm doesnt think Bidens policies are to blame at all she says thank the activity of Vladimir Putin.
With all due respect, Madame Secretary, thats utter nonsense, Hawley said. The average gas price in my state was $2.07. Eight months later, eight months later, long before Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, that price was up over 30, and its been going up consistently since.
Hawley reminded Granholm what Biden has done to affect gas prices and hurt the supply chain.
Things got tense between Senator Josh Hawley R-MO and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm during aSenate Armed Services Committee hearing. Hawley pressed Granholm on Bidens failed energy policies and their effect on gas prices.

Heres what your president did when he first came to office: he re-entered the Paris Climate Accord he canceled the Keystone pipeline he halted leasing programs in ANWR he issued a 60-day halt on all new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands and waters that accounts for 25 of U.S. oil production he directed federal agencies to eliminate all supports for fossil fuels he imposed new regulations on oil and gas and methane emissions and that was just in the first few days. Youre telling me that had no effect?
