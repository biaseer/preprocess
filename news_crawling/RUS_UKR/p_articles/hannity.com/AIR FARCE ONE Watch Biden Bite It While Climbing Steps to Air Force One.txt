Despite the brief blip, the commander-in-chief boarded the plane without incident, holding the rail with his right hand as he ascended.
Biden, 79, appeared to momentarily lose his balance as he walked up to the presidential plane at Andrews Airforce Base en route to Illinois, footage shows.
79-year old President Joe Biden took another trip up the steps of Air Force One on Wednesday, again drawing questions about his physical fitness. Biden took a similar stumble last month while en route to Illinois.
Biden was in Illinois to visit a farm, where he blamed Russias invasion of Ukraine for increased global food prices. He also hosted a Chicago fundraiser and met with union supporters.
