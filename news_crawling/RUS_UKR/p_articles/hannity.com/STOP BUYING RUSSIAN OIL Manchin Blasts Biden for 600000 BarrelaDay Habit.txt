The entire world is watching as Vladimir Putin uses energy as a weapon in an attempt to extort and coerce our European allies, said Mr. Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee. While Americans decry what is happening in Ukraine, the United States continues to allow the import of more than half a million barrels per day of crude oil and other petroleum products from Russia during this time of war.
To continue to ask other countries to do what we can do for ourselves in a cleaner way is hypocritical, Manchin said. To continue to rely on Russian energy as they attack Ukraine is senseless.
Instead, the senator urged the White House to incentive domestic energy production and use punitive measures, including tariffs and importation bans, against Russian oil, the Washington Times reports.
Senator Joe Manchin D-WV wants President Biden to stop importing Russian oil and ramp up American energy production ASAP. Enriching Russia while they invade Ukraine is ridiculous, totally ridiculous, says Manchin.
