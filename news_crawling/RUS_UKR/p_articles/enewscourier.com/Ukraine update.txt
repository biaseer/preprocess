Recently, The News Courier brought you a story on the Hill Family in Cullman County. Molly Luba Hill and Stephanie Hills biological families live in Ukraine including Mollys brother Dima. He is currently a member of the Ukrainian Army on the front lines defending against the Russian invasion. Mollys mother, Becca Hill, has provided updates as she has been able to get them.
He is alive. I am texting with him right now, Hill said. He cant tell me what happened yesterday or where he is now because they are reading his texts. They have moved locations. Please keep praying.
March 22, All is fine, Dima wrote. Two days later he sent another short message, Good today.
On March 19, Russia attacked the Ukrainian military barracks in Mykolaiv with three missiles as hundreds of soldiers slept. This had been the last known whereabouts of Dima at the time. After learning about the attack, Hill was unable to reach Dima for almost two days.
