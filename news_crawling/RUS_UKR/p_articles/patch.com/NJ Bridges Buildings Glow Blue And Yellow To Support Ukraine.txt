The talks are expected to take place Thursday in Belarus, the head of the Russian delegation said. The talks were announced the same day the U.N. General Assembly condemned the invasion and called on Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.

ACROSS NEW JERSEY  Buildings and bridges throughout New Jersey are lighting up blue and yellow in a show of solidarity with Ukraine, a European country under attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army.
On Saturday, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy tweeted, "Over the last few days, the Ukrainian people have shown that they will not bow to thugs like Vladimir Putin. We stand with ZelenskyyUa in supporting a free and independent Ukraine."
The human toll of the war also continues to mount. The number of Ukrainians who have fled from their homeland is expected to reach 1 million soon and the Ukrainian government put the civilian death toll in the thousands, according to The Associated Press, which couldn't verify the claim.
