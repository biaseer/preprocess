President Biden announced another set of sanctions against Russia in retaliation to its invasion of Ukraine that began Wednesday morning. Russian forces crossed into Ukraine in the three separate Army groups and began bombing the country, firing at least 160 missiles into the country. As of Friday morning, Russian soldiers were closing in on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.
"People are hurting," Anya Nona, a 30-year-old Warren resident, told MLive. "This is not something that hasnt happened before to Ukraine, but this is a different feeling. Putin doesnt think Ukraine has a right to exist."
