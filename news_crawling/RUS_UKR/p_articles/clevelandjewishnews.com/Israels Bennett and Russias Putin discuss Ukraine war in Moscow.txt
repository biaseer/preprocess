Bennett and a small group of advisers took off for Russia early Saturday morning, his office said. The two leaders had discussed the meeting during a conversation on Wednesday morning.
Bennett has been holding talks with both Putin and Russian President Volodymyr Zelensky since the war began more than a week ago.
Last week, Bennett told Israels Channel 13 that Israel was being considered as a potential broker in talks between Russia and Ukraine.
Included in the meeting are Housing and Construction Minister Zeev Elkin, who speaks Russian and is serving as a translator, the head of Israel National Security Council, Eyal Hulata, and Bennetts spokesperson Matan Sidi.
