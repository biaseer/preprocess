This is a military that  continues to grow stronger, continues to grow more ready. Theyre exercising, so we believe that he Russian President Vladimir Putin has a lot of capabilities and options available to him should he want to use military force, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told MSNBC on Monday.
Axios said that the message shows just how seriously the Israeli government is taking the threat of an all-out Russian invasion. While 3,000 Israeli citizens have evacuated since Sunday, the Israeli government believes around 10,000 remain in Ukraine.
According to the report, a conversation was held between Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Alon Ushpiz and Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov.
Ushpiz stressed the commitment and concern of the Israeli government to the safety and security of its citizens and diplomats in Ukraine, Israeli Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lior Haiat told Axios.
