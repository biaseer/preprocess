The Kremlin said on Thursday December 2 that the probability of a new conflict in eastern Ukraine remained high and that Moscow was concerned by "aggressive" rhetoric from Kyiv and an increase in what it called provocative actions.
The comments come amid Ukrainian and western concerns over a buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine. Moscow denies planning an invasion and accuses Ukraine of building up its own forces in the east of the country.
Peskov also said that Russia viewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's pledge to return annexed Crimea as a direct threat.
"Such a formulation means that Kyiv may use any option, including force, to try and encroach on a Russian region," he said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Moscow was worried about the possibility of a Ukrainian military move in eastern Ukraine, something that Kyiv has denied planning.
