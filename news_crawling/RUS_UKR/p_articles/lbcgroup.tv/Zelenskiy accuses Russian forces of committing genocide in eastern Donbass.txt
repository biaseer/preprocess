He added that the Russian forces are practicing "deportation" and "mass killing of civilians" in the Donbass, considering that "all of this ... constitutes a clear genocidal policy implemented by Russia."
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused on Thursday Russian forces of committing "genocide" in the eastern Donbass.
In his daily televised speech, Zelenskiy said that "the current offensive of the occupiers in the Donbass region may make the area uninhabited," accusing the Russian forces of seeking to "flatten" many of the cities and towns there.
