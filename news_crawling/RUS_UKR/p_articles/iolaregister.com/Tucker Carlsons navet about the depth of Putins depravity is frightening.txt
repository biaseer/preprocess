Carlson seems to be exploiting Americans exceedingly short memories and attention spans as he articulates a new Republican philosophy that is the exact opposite of everything the partys iconic leader, Ronald Reagan, stood for. Carlson proposes embracing Russia as an ally and effectively excusing all of its past transgressions  of course including Russian President Vladimir Putins help engineering Donald Trumps 2016 presidential election.
Why is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine? Carlson asked on his show last week to the applause of several GOP members of Congress. The reception was more chilly in 2019 when Carlson stated: Why do I care about  what is going on in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? And Im serious. Why do I care? Why shouldnt I root for Russia? Which I am.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson has inspired a new following from the extreme right, including some members of Congress, by asking: Why take Ukraines side instead of Russias? The arguments are vast for defending the sovereignty of democratic Ukraine, and most American adults should need no reminders why containing Moscows expansionist desires is essential for U.S. national security.
