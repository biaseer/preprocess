That muddied efforts to determine the significance of the announcement, which buoyed world financial markets and the long-suffering ruble after weeks of escalation in Europes worst East-West standoff in decades. It came a day after Russias foreign minister indicatedthe country was ready to keep talkingabout the security grievances that led to the Ukraine crisis  a gesture that changed the tenor after weeks of tensions.
Yet hours before the Russian Defense Ministry statement about the troops, a U.S. defense official said Russian units were moving closer to the Ukrainian border  not away from it.

NATOs chief said the alliance had no proof yet of a Russian retreat.
