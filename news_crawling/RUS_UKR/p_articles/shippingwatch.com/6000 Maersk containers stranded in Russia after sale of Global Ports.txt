Losses in Maersks Ocean division has thereby been reduced by USD 93m in the second quarter, and the overall loss linked to the terminated business in Russia is now at USD 624m compared to USD 718m previously.
As previously reported by ShippingWatch, the buyer is a Russian partner and current co-owner, Delo Group, which is owned by businessman Sergey Shishkarev.
As such, APM Terminals has no activities left in Russia. This is, however, not the case for Maersk, which is still trying to recover thousands of stranded containers from the country.
Previously in the year, Maersk decided to withdraw from Russia as a consequence of the countrys invasion of Ukraine. In relation to the announcement of its Q1 result in May, the Danish shipping company announced that the Ukraine war so far had had a cost of USD 718m on the operating result EBIT, divided between impairments and costs linked to leaving Russia.
Bringing home containers has gone beyond expectations, meaning we only have 6,000 left as of Aug. 3, writes Maersks press division in an email to ShippingWatch.
However, as evident from the half-year report presented by Maersk on Aug. 3, the carrier has succeeded with reducing losses and furthermore bringing home 14,000 of the 20,000 containers stuck in Russia.
Maersks APM Terminals has divested remaining interest in Russian port company Global Ports, which the company has been trying to offload since the invasion of Ukraine in February.
