Two flights carrying about 200 displaced Ukrainian citizens are set to touch down in Regina late Wednesday night.
After arriving in Regina after a stopover in Edmonton, the passengers will step off the ramp to find temporary accommodations and a suite of support services waiting for them, according to the Government of Saskatchewan.
On-site staff from a settlement reception centre will be on hand to answer questions, issue health cards, help with bank accounts, and provide information on housing, employment, education, income assistance and more.
