LVIV, Ukraine AP  Waves of Russian missiles pounded a military training base near Ukraines western border with NATO member Poland, killing 35 people, Ukrainian authorities said Sunday. The strike followed Russian threats to target foreign weapon shipments that are helping Ukrainian fighters defend their country against Russias grinding assault.
More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the sprawling training facility that is less than 25 kilometers 15 miles from the closest border point with Poland, according to the governor of Ukraines western Lviv region. Poland is a transit route for Western military aid to Ukraine, and the United States increased the number of America troops deployed there.
It has also hosted international NATO drills. As such, the site symbolizes a longstanding Russian complaint: that the 30-member Western military alliance has expanded in Eastern Europe too close to Russian territory. One of Moscows stated conditions for ending the hostilities in Ukraine is for the country to drop its ambitions to join NATO.
The training center near Yavoriv appears to be the westernmost target struck during Russias 18-day invasion. The facility, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, has long been used to train Ukrainian military personnel, often with instructors from the U.S. and other NATO countries.
