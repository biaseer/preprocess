The two eastern cities span the strategically-important Siverskiy Donetsk river. They are the last major areas under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province, which makes up the Donbas together with neighboring Donetsk.
POKROVSK, Ukraine AP  Russian and Ukrainian troops engaged in close-quarter combat in an eastern Ukraine city Sunday as Moscows soldiers, supported by intense shelling, attempted to gain strategic footholds for conquering the region in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance.
Ukrainian regional officials reported Russian forces storming Sievierodonetsk after trying unsuccessfully to encircle the city. The fighting knocked out power and cellphone service, and a humanitarian relief center could not operate because of the danger, the mayor said.
Sievierodonetsk, located about 143 kilometers 89 miles south of the Russian border, emerged in recent days as the epicenter of Moscows quest to capture all of Ukraines industrial Donbas region. Russia also stepped up its efforts to take nearby Lysychansk, where civilians rushed to escape persistent shelling.
