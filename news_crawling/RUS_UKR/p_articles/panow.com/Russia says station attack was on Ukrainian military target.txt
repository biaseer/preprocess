CHAPLYNE, Ukraine AP  The death toll from a Russian rocket attack on a train station and the surrounding area as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day climbed to 25, including at least two children, Ukrainian authorities said Thursday. Russia said it targeted a military train and claimed to have killed more than 200 Ukrainian reservists.
Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an increase in his countrys armed forces of 137,000, or more than 13. That would bring Russias overall troop strength to more than 1.15 million.
The bloodshed came as Ukraine was braced for attacks tied to the national holiday and wars six-month mark, both of which fell on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had warned that Russia might try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel this week.
