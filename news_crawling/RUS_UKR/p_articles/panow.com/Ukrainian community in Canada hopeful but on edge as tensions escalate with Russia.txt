Matsiuk, who has been living in Saskatoon since 2011, has a sister living in the capital city of Kyiv and her mother and grandmother live in the northwestern area of Volyn.
Iryna Matsiuk checks the news as soon as she wakes up each morning, hoping the escalating Russian-Ukrainian crisis wont put her family in harms way.
Last weekend, I actually was pressuring my sister, asking, Do you have an evacuations plan? Matsiuk said. Kyiv is a big city and its not the easiest city to get out of, especially if everyone starts leaving.
Her friends and family in Ukraine have been staying calm as tensions with Russia escalate, but Matsiuk said she cant help but worry for them.
