Blinken will be in Kyiv on the hastily arranged trip to show U.S. support following inconclusive diplomatic talks between Moscow and the West in Europe last week that failed to resolve stark disagreements over Ukraine and other security matters.
Blinkens travel and consultations are part of the diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the tension caused by Russias military build-up and continued aggression against Ukraine, the State Department said in a statement.
Instead, those meetings appear to have increased fears of a Russian invasion, and the Biden administration has accused Russia of preparing a false flag operation to use as a pretext for intervention. Russia has angrily denied the charge.
WASHINGTON AP  Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Ukraine this week and meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalate over a possible Russian invasion of its neighbor, the State Department said Tuesday.
