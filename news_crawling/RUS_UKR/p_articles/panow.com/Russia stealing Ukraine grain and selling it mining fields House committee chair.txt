OTTAWA  Kody Blois, chair of the House of Commons agriculture committee, says Russian troops have been pilfering Ukraines grain stores and selling them on the international market via Syria.
Ukraines silos contain millions of tonnes of grain destined for global markets including in the Middle East and Africa but the embattled country is unable to export it via ports such as Odesa.
The Liberal MP noted today that a Ukrainian MP had told the committee that Russia has stolen around 500,000 tonnes of grain from Ukrainian silos in territory it has occupied.
Bloiss expression of concern comes amid warnings from aid agencies that Russias blocking of Ukraines ports could lead to starvation in the developing world.
