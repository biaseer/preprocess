Zelenskyy accused the Kremlin of deliberately creating  a humanitarian catastrophe  and appealed for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with him, using a huge Moscow stadium rally where Putin lavished praise on Russian forces Friday to illustrate what was at stake.
The rally and a concert in Moscow were held to commemorate the anniversary of Russias annexation of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine on 2014. The event included patriotic songs such as Made in the U.S.S.R., with the opening lines Ukraine and Crimea, Belarus and Moldova, its all my country.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces are blockading his countrys largest cities to wear the population down into submission, but he warned Saturday that the strategy will fail and Moscow will lose in the long run if it doesnt end its war.
Just picture for yourself that in that stadium in Moscow there are 14,000 dead bodies and tens of thousands more injured and maimed. Those are the Russian costs throughout the invasion, Zelenskyy said in a nightly video address to the nation recorded outside the presidential office in Kyiv.
