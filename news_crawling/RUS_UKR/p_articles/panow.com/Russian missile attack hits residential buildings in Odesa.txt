KYIV, Ukraine AP  Ukrainian emergency services say missile attacks have struck residential buildings in Ukraines Odesa region, causing deaths and injuries.
The assault comes after Russian forces withdrew from Snake Island, a key Black Sea island, on Thursday, potentially easing the threat to the vital Ukrainian port city of Odesa. But they kept up their push to encircle the last stronghold of resistance in the eastern province of Luhansk.
