Pennsylvania Rep. Dan Meuser and Fox News contributor Liz Peek weigh in on Democrats' resistance to U.S. energy independence.
Prices have been on a rollercoaster ride due to the supply crunch from sanctions on Russia, stuttering nuclear talks with Iran, dwindling oil stockpiles and worries about a surge of COVID-19 cases in China, according to Reuters.
This volatility is raising concerns about a prolonged disruption to oil supply, according to Reuters.
Even with the rebound, both benchmark prices were set to end the week down about 4. Prices have dropped from 14-year highs hit nearly two weeks ago.
It marks the third volatile week of trade as there was slim progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.
