Eligible employees who volunteer for this situation may be selected to serve a temporary duty assignment in Poland to facilitate travelers for entry into the U.S., to include providing guidance and problems resolution to other government agencies, it continues.
The memo says volunteers must be ready to deploy within 2 or 3 days of selection, and plan for approximately one months work overseas. It also offered a COVID-19 mitigation strategy in which workers must either have natural immunity or a COVID-19 vaccine.
Despite the ongoing conflict at the U.S. southern border, Biden ordered Customs and Border Protection agents to Europe to assist those fleeing from the Russian invasion.
In a Thursday memo, CBPs office of field operations sought volunteers willing to deploy immediately to Poland for Operation Ukraine Support, Just the News reports.
As a mission necessity and to avoid post-arrival quarantine, volunteers must be able to provide a negative PCR test taken within 24 hours of arrival and meet one of the following conditions: fully vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccination or recovered from COVID-19 within six months prior to arrival.
Once deployed employees are expected to perform all assigned duties and may be required to work irregular shifts and schedules, up to seven days per week including holidays and weekends, the memo warned, offering volunteers overtime pay.
The Office of Field Operations is seeking volunteers to assist with the possible evacuation of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their immediate family members from Ukraine, the memo reads.
