EU Foreign Policy Chief Joseph Borrell said the collective of European countries would close its airspace to Russian traffic, which was quickly followed by an announcement from Russian airline Aeroflot that it would cancel all flights to European destinations, Just the News reports.
The U.S. has yet to make an announcement, but officials are reportedly considering similar action.
Canada has also closed its airspace to Russian flights, though there were no direct flights between the two countries.
Europe and Canada on Sunday closed their airspace to Russian planes, another move intended to pressure Putin to halt his Ukraine invasion.
