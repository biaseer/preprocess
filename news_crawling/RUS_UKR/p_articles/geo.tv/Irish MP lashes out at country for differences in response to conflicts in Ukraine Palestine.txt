Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air, and sea on February 24 in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.
Russian troops also landed by sea at the port cities of Odessa and Mariupol in the south.
DUBLIN: Irish politician Richard Boyd Barrett has called out Irelands "utter hypocrisy" in terms of response to global conflicts, saying that when Russia invaded Ukraine, sanctions were imposed within five days, while "70 years of oppression in Palestine brought about no such repercussions for Israel.
Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities and Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions.
You do not even want to use the word apartheid, never mind imposing sanctions, he said.
Youre happy to correctly use the most strong and robust language to describe the crimes of Russias Vladimir Putin against humanity, he said, but you will not use the same strength of language when it comes to describing Israels treatment of Palestinians.
We continue to think sanctions against Israel will not help, even though Palestines case is being documented by the most respected human rights organisation in the world, he said.
