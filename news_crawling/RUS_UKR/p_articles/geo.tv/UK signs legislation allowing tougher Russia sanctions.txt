London: The UK government on Thursday signed into law new legislation giving it powers to impose tougher and broader sanctions on Russia if Moscow steps up its aggression against Ukraine.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told broadcasters in Warsaw that there must be an automatic package of sanctions ready to go if Russia attacks Ukraine.
The changes mean the UK can now impose sanctions not only on those who are linked directly to the destabilisation of Ukraine, the Foreign Office said.
The UK can now impose sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals in a wide range of economic and strategically significant sectors, the government said, listing chemical, defence and IT industries and financial services.
This came as UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss visited Moscow and met her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, who said afterwards he was disappointed by the talks.
The UK government said Minister for Europe James Cleverly had signed the legislation, providing a framework for the strongest sanctions regime the UK has had against Russia.
He said this should include the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, calling this a very, very important priority.
It can now target entities and businesses affiliated to the Russian government and their owners, directors and trustees.
London said the new legislation was part of measures to urge the Kremlin to end its campaign of aggression in Ukraine, as fears of an invasion grow.
The new legislation entered force after being signed by a minister and formally laid before Parliament, a procedure that does not require a vote by MPs.
