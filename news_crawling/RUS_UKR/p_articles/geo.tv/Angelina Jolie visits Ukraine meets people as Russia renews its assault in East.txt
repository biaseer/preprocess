She appeared to be with one male friend in the coffee shop, but interacted with fans who were excited to see her in their country on such a low-key visit.
The 46-year-old drew attention as she appeared wearing nondescript clothing at the cafe amid the ongoing attacks by Russian forces on the country.
Angelina Jolie, who has been visiting Ukraine to meet with refugees and show support for the country, had to hurry away to the safety of an air-raid bunker in Lviv as air raid sires blasted off during her visit to city.
A video of her visit was shared on Facebook by Maya Pidhorodetska, who added: Nothing special. Just Lviv. I just went to have coffee. Just Angelina Jolie.
Fans recognised the star, who smiled and waved as they filmed her on their phones and signed an autograph while waiting for her drink.
Hollywood star and humanitarian Angelina Jolie surprised Ukrainians after turning up to a cafe in Lviv on Saturday as Russia renewed its assault in the East.
Little is known about her visit, but she was seen looking relaxed in wide-legged grey trousers and a slouchy jumper as she made a low-key visit to get a coffee in Lviv.
Jolie, known for her humanitarian work, travelled to Ukraine, which has been devastated by shelling since February.
