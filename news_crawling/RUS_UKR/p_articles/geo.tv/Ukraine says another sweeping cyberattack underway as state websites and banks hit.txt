Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks posted a tweet on Thursday that showed a drop-off in connections to the Ukrainian government websites.
Weve observed that the current network disruption has partial impact on the network layer to multiple defence and ministerial websites in Ukraine, NetBlocks director Alp Toker told Reuters.
The online networks of Ukraines defence ministry and two banks were overwhelmed last week in a separate cyber attack. The US company Netscout Systems Inc NTCT.O later said the impact had been modest.
KYIV: The websites of Ukraines government, foreign ministry and state security service were down on Wednesday in what the government said was the start of another massive denial of service DDoS attack that began at around 4 pm 1400 GMT.
He did not mention which banks were affected and the central bank could not immediately be reached for comment.
At about 4pm, another mass DDoS attack on our state began. We have relevant data from a number of banks, said Mykhailo Fedorov, Minister of Digital Transformation, adding that the parliament website was also hit.
Ukraine has suffered a string of cyberattacks that Kyiv has blamed on Russia. Moscow, which is caught up in a mounting confrontation with the West over Ukraine, has denied any involvement.
The spread of outages is similar but distinct from the recent DDOS attack targeting defence and banking platforms, with the latter not impacted in this instance, he added.
Ukrainian authorities said this week they had seen online warnings that hackers were preparing to launch major attacks on government agencies, banks and the defence sector.
