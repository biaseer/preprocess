The Principality has adopted and implemented, without delay, procedures for freezing funds and economic sanctions identical to those taken by most European States.
A similar move by the French finance minister has also been carried out amid Ukraines growing unrest and the country has decided to launch an all-out economic and financial war on Russia via a rolling programme of sanctions every few weeks.
This statement comes shortly after The Formula One Russian Grand Prix was also cancelled over fears of an international boycott by other drivers and teams.
Prince Albert of Monaco has just announced his solidarity and support towards the people of Ukraine, with the immediate implementation of all-out economic, financial sanctions against the oligarchs of Russia, as well as Putin.
The prince announced his intentions in a statement that reads, Prince Albert of Monaco supported all efforts aimed at halting the fighting in Ukraine and encouraging the withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Ukrainian territory.
While the Palace has not publically announced the names on their hit list, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss revealed that the list has been drawn up to target oligarchs private jets, and added that well be targeting their properties, well be targeting other possession that they have and there will be nowhere to hide.
The statement concluded with a show of support to suffering Ukrainians and called for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire.
As part of the plan, France aims to seize the yachts of the oligarchs instead of simply freezing them, a move, unlike other West world countries.
These sanctions come as part of a further blow against Russias oligarchs and other super-elite who prefer to dock on Monacos shores because of its reputation as a tax haven.
