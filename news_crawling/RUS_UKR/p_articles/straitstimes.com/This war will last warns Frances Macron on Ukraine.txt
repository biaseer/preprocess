"If I can tell you one thing this morning it is that this war will last," Mr Macron told France's annual agriculture fair.
Mr Macron cut short his visit to the agriculture fair, usually one of the main fixtures on the French political calendar, in order to return to dealing with the crisis triggered by the Russian invasion.
The French leader was a key figure in efforts to avert conflict, repeatedly speaking to Mr Putin and seeking in vain to broker a summit between the Russian leader and US President Joe Biden.
"This crisis will last, this war will last and all the crises that come with it will have lasting consequences," he added, warning: "We must be prepared."
Mr Macron, who is expected to seek and win a second term, has left the official declaration of his candidacy to the last minute, although he must make a move next week ahead of a March 4 deadline to register.
PARIS AFP - The world must brace for a long war between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow launched an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour, French President Emmanuel Macron warned on Saturday Feb 26.
The war has also broken out as the clock ticks down to France's presidential elections in April.
"War has returned to Europe, this was chosen unilaterally by President Vladimir Putin, with a tragic humanitarian situation, a Ukrainian people who are resisting and a Europe that is there and resisting by the side of the Ukrainian people," said Mr Macron.
With the war and sanctions against Russia risking damage for specific sectors in France, notably the wine industry, he vowed a "plan of resilience" to help them cope.
