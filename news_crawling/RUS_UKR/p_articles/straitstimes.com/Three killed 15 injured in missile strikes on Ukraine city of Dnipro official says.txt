"The rockets hit an industrial plant and a busy street next to it," Rezynchenko said on his Facebook page. "We are determining the extent of the destruction."
"The man had finished his work day and was headed to the depot to go back to work at 5am tomorrow. He didn't make it," Ivan Vasyuchkov wrote.
"Two children have been left without a father. A really young guy, my age, he still had so much time to live. There are simply no words," he added.
