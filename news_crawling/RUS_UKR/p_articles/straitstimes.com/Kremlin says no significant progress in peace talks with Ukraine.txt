Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said significant progress in the talks still had to be made for there to be a basis for a possible meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.
"Those countries who can should use their influence over Kyiv to make it more accommodating and construction at these talks," he added.
Ukraine has said it is willing to negotiate but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums.
"For us to speak of a meeting between the two presidents, homework has to be done. Talks have to be held and their results agreed upon," Mr Peskov said.
Mr Peskov also reiterated claims that Russia was showing more willingness than Ukrainian negotiators to work towards an agreement at the talks.
MOSCOW REUTERS - The Kremlin said on Monday March 21 that peace talks between Russia and Ukraine had not yet made any significant progress.
