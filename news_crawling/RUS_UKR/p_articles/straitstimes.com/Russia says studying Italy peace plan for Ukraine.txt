"We have received it recently and are studying it," Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told reporters.
Talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the hostilities have essentially ground to a halt.
"We will be ready to resume as soon as Ukraine shows a constructive position and at least provides a reaction to the proposals submitted to it."
The Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers met for inconclusive talks in Turkey in March, followed by a meeting of the delegations in Istanbul, which also failed to bring about concrete results.
"It has not been discussed between Russia and Italy," he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies.
MOSCOW AFP - Russia said on Monday May 23 it was looking over an Italian peace plan proposal to end the conflict in Ukraine.
"Freezing the current negotiations and putting everything on pause is not our initiative," Rudenko said.
Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations have been held regularly, both in person and via video-link, since the Russian military offensive began on Feb 24.
Russia's lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Sunday that Russia was willing to resume negotiations but the onus was on Kyiv.
