"The main thing is that the talks continue, either in Istanbul or somewhere else," said Peskov, adding that the negotiations were "not easy".
Russia would like to continue talks in neighbouring Belarus, but Kyiv opposed the idea, he said.
MOSCOW REUTERS - Russia's talks with a "hostile" Ukraine have not been easy, but the main thing is that they are continuing, RIA news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying on Saturday April 2.
Peskov said Moscow had launched the invasion to "save" two eastern regions seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014 and said he trusted that the Russian language would be restored to its rightful place in the country.
"Ukraine is a very difficult country, very difficult for us. In its current state, it is hostile towards us," the agency cited him as telling Belarus television.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia's "special operation" in Ukraine was needed "to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide". By this, he meant those whose first or only language is Russian.
Russia and Ukraine have held several rounds of negotiations, both in Turkey and by video conference.
