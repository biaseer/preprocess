MOSCOW AFP - Russian President Vladimir Putin said several proposals put forward by his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at talks on Monday Feb 7 could form a basis for moving forward on the crisis over Ukraine.
If Ukraine joins the Western military bloc, Russia could get sucked into conflict with European countries, he added.
He did not provide any details but said the two leaders would speak by phone after Mr Macron meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday.
With tens of thousands of Russian troops camped near the Ukrainian border, Mr Macron was the first top Western leader to meet Mr Putin since the crisis began in December.
Mr Putin said he was grateful to Mr Macron for his efforts to solve the security crisis.
"A number of his ideas, proposals... are possible as a basis for further steps," Mr Putin said after more than five hours of talks with Mr Macron in the Kremlin.
"Kyiv still rejects every opportunity for a peaceful restoration of its territorial integrity," Mr Putin said.
The Russian leader said the Ukrainian authorities were to blame for the continued conflict in the country's east.
Mr Macron flew to Moscow at the start of a week of intense Western diplomacy aimed at easing fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.
"I would like to thank Mr Macron for the efforts France is making to resolve the acute issue of our relations with Nato, to create an environment of stability on the European continent, to resolve the crisis in south-eastern Ukraine," Mr Putin said.
