The self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria bordering Ukraine seceded from Moldova in 1992 after a brief war with Chisinau.
"One bounced off onto the sidewalk, the other got stuck in window grates. The fire was promptly extinguished by security," the ministry said.
Around 30 minutes later, "two Molotov cocktails were thrown" at a conscription office in central Tiraspol.
Kyiv has accused Russia of wanting to destabilise the region to create a pretext for a military intervention.
The incidents come after a string of attacks were reported in the separatist region, with fears mounting of a spillover from the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine.
"At around 4.15am in the morning, a car stopped near an oil depot of one enterprise, from which an unidentified man got out, threw a Molotov cocktail towards the building and fled," the Interior Ministry of the self-proclaimed republic said in a statement.
Fears of a spillover from the Ukraine conflict grew after a Russian general said the Kremlin's military campaign - launched on Feb 24 - aimed to create a land corridor through southern Ukraine to Transnistria.
CHISINAU AFP - Authorities in Moldova's Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria said on Friday May 13 two attempted attacks were carried out on infrastructure in the regional capital Tiraspol.
