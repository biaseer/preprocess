The Geneva-based Council passed the resolution through a vote, with 33 members voting in favour and 2 against including China and Eritrea.
GENEVA REUTERS - The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday May 12 passed a resolution by a strong majority, setting up an investigation into allegations of rights abuses by Russian troops in parts of Ukraine formerly under their control.
However, it could still have joined the session as an observer but chose not to do so in protest at the resolution which it said amounted to political score-settling.
