"Singapore is gravely concerned at the escalation of tensions at the Ukraine-Russia border and the Russian decision to recognise two breakaway Ukrainian regions," a spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs MFA said in a statement.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent.
Singapore on Tuesday Feb 22 said all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis must pursue dialogue to reach a peaceful settlement and avoid any action that would further raise tensions.
The MFA statement said: "All parties concerned should continue to pursue dialogue, including diplomatic means, towards a peaceful settlement of the dispute, in accordance with international law, and avoid action that will further raise tensions in the region."
