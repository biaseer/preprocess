Despite the ongoing war, the international community is trying to sustain the nascent "grain corridor" to help Ukraine export its agricultural products to the world market. In the meanwhile, a ship that left the port of Odessa with Ukrainian grain got delayed as it failed to reach the Lebanese port of Tripoli on Sunday.
"Spoke with Indian Foreign Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar to thank him for India's humanitarian aid to Ukraine. We discussed ways to strengthen our bilateral cooperation and focused on the safety and security of Indian students. I reiterated that Russia must end its war on Ukraine," said Mr. Kuleba, updating about the conversation.
"Discussed recent developments in the conflict and its continuing global repercussions. Assured that the next consignment of Indian humanitarian assistance will be reaching very soon," said Mr. Jaishankar in a social media message. India had sent relief material earlier through flights that used Romania and Poland to send the goods to Ukraine.
India will send a new consignment of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine soon, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Monday. India had sent consignments of medicines and other items needed in Ukraine as the country continues to fight against the Russian forces.
The relief materials were provided when India also conducted Operation Ganga to evacuate Indian students and professionals who were stuck in Ukraine as Russia launched the "special military operation" on February 24.
