Russia on Saturday said its troops could target supplies of Western weapons in Ukraine, where the Russian Army has been advancing since late February.
Moscow has been hit by a barrage of international sanctions since Mr. Putin sent in troops.
Mr. Ryabkov said Moscow had warned about the consequences of the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of weapons like man-portable air defence systems, anti-tank missile systems and so on.
President Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine on February 24 and said he aims to de-Nazify the country.
We warned the United States that the orchestrated pumping of weapons from a number of countries is not just a dangerous move, it is a move that turns these convoys into legitimate targets, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told state television.
The Russian Foreign Minister said Washington had not taken Moscows warnings seriously and added that Russia and the U.S. were not holding any negotiation processes on Ukraine.
