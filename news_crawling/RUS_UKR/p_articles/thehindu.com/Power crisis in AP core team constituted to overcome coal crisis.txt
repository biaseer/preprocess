According to an official release, several States, including Andhra Pradesh, are facing power shortage with the TPPs having coal stocks that last three to five days on an average against the recommended 24 days.
The power price in the exchange this year stood at around 12 per unit, which is the highest in the last 10 years. The A.P. power utilities are forced to purchase power at that rate even in the peak hours.
On the other hand, the demand for electricity has increased phenomenally due to the revival of the economy in the post-pandemic situation.
Several States are facing a same situation. The peak demand met so far in April 2022 was 12,293 MW, which was a 6 increase from 11,570 MW recorded in April 2021.
The demand in Andhra Pradesh was 63,605 Million Units MU in 2018-19. It has surged to 68,905 MU now, but the coal supply has not increased at the same pace.
Energy Minister Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy has constituted acore management team exclusively to deal with the prevailing power shortage that necessitated imposition of Restriction  Control RC measures on the industrial sector.
The team is mandated to closely monitor the coal stocks at the thermal power plants TPPs and ensure that there are no disruptions in fuel supply by coordinating with the government.
The TPPs are said to account for more than 50 of the countrys total power capacity. The RussiaUkraine war has also contributed to the coal crisis, it is said.
The TPPs across the country have curtailed power generation due to shortage of coal and its soaring prices in the global market.
