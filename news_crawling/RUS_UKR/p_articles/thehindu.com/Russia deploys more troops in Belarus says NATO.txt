Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu arrived in Belarus on Thursday to inspect Russian and Belarusian troops and was due to meet Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Interfax news agency said.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: Over the last days, we have seen a significant movement of Russian military forces into Belarus. This is the biggest Russian deployment there since the Cold War, with an expected 30,000 combat troops as well as Spetsnaz special operations forces, SU-35 fighter jets, S-400 air defence systems and nuclear-capable Iskander missiles, he said.
Ukraines Defence Minister said Russia had currently massed a total of 1,15,000 troops near Ukraines borders.
Russia denies planning to invade Ukraine and has described the Allied Resolve exercises with Belarus as a rehearsal in repelling external aggression. It has not disclosed the size of its forces there but says they will withdraw after the drills.
The Russia-Belarus exercises, running until February 20, have provided Moscow with cover to further increase forces near Ukraine at a time when the United States and Britain have warned that Moscow may be gearing up for war.
NATO said Russia had stepped up deployments to Ukraines northern neighbour Belarus in recent days and was expected to have 30,000 troops there for joint military exercises this month.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who offered to mediate in the crisis, was due to visit Kiev on Thursday.
