Russian and Ukrainian officials met on Monday on the border between Belarus and Ukraine for the first talks since the outbreak of war.
Ukraine says more than 350 civilians have been killed since Moscow launched its attack last Thursday.
Mr. Peskov said they did not require permission from Moscow to do so but declined to say how many Russians have been killed.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed about the talks and that "it is too soon to assess" their outcome.
Mr. Peskov said Russian forces "do not carry out strikes against civilian infrastructure or residential complexes", despite widespread evidence otherwise.
Russia has admitted losses but has not disclosed how many of its troops have died so far.
Russian troops also reached the southern city of Kherson on Tuesday, advancing from Moscow-annexed Crimea.
He spoke several hours after Ukrainian officials said the Russian army shelled the central square of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.
He said Moscow aims to "demilitarise and de-Nazify" Ukraine, as well as protect Russia from a "military threat created by Western countries".
The Kremlin on Tuesday said it was too early to draw conclusions from a first round of talks held with Ukraine on ending the war following Moscow's invasion last week.
Moscow's defence minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier on Tuesday that Russia would continue its offensive in Ukraine until its "goals are achieved."
