Ukraine has said it will take at least $750 billion to rebuild after the widespread destruction inflicted by the Russian invasion force.
The statement recalls that the court based in the Hague called on March 16 for Moscow to end the war.
We reiterate that Russia must be held accountable for its actions. In this regard, we consider that Russias violations of international law engage its international responsibility, it said.
In a statement, the 40-odd countries said they support Ukraines proceedings before the International Court of Justice seeking to establish that Russia has no lawful basis to take military action in Ukraine on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations of genocide.
This alludes to Russias stated justification early in the war that it invaded to halt what it called genocide in pro-Russian areas of eastern Ukraine.
Dozens of countries from around the world called on Russia on Wednesday to halt the war in Ukraine.
The International Court of Justice is the highest U.N. court and its rulings are binding and not open to appeal.
The statement added that the losses and damage suffered by Ukraine as a result of Russias violations of international law require full and urgent reparation by Russia.
It bases its rulings mainly on international treaties and conventions but has no means of enforcing its decisions.
