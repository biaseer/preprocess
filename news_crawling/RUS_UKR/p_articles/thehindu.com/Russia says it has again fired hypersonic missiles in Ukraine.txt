Russia said on Sunday it has again fired its newest Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, destroying a fuel storage site in the countrys south.
The Russian defence ministry also said it killed more than 100 members of Ukrainian special forces and foreign mercenaries when it targeted a training centre in the town of Ovruch in northern Ukraine with sea-based missiles.
The Ukrainian armed forces confirmed to AFP on Saturday that the depot had been targeted but said they had no information of the type of missile.
The Russian defence ministry said that it also used long-range precision weapons against other facilities in Ukraine on Saturday evening and early Sunday.
Russian analysts said the use Friday of the Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in Deliatyn, a village in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, was the first combat use of such weapons in the world.
Russian forces fired the Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea to target a plant in the northern city of Nizhyn used to repair armoured vehicles, the ministry said.
The Kinzhal Dagger hypersonic missiles were fired from airspace over Russian-controlled Crimea, the ministry said, adding that Kalibr cruise missiles launched from the Caspian Sea had also targeted the depot.
Kinzhal aviation missile systems with hypersonic ballistic missiles destroyed a large storage site for fuels and lubricants of the Ukrainian armed forces near the settlement of Kostyantynivka in the Mykolaiv region, the defence ministry said.
On Saturday, Russia said it had used the Kinzhal hypersonic missiles to destroy an underground missile and ammunition storage site in western Ukraine close to the border with NATO member Romania.
The ministry said the base had been used for the main supplies of fuel for Ukrainian armoured vehicles in the countrys south.
