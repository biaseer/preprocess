The Russian military said on Thursday that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country's Kaliningrad region, a move that comes amid soaring tensions with the West over Moscow's action in Ukraine.
A video released by the Defense Ministry showed the fighters arriving at the base but not carrying the missiles, which were apparently delivered separately.
Kaliningrads location has put it in the forefront of Moscows efforts to counter what it described as NATOs hostile policies. The Kremlin has methodically bolstered its military forces there, arming them with state-of-the-art weapons, including precision-guided Iskander missiles and an array of air defense systems.
The deployment of Kinzhal missiles to Kaliningrad as Russias campaign in Ukraine nears the sixth-month mark appeared intended to showcase the Russian militarys capability to threaten NATO assets. The region borders NATO members Poland and Lithuania.
Russia's Defense Ministry said three MiG-31 fighters with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles arrived at the Chkalovsk airbase in the Baltic Sea enclave as part of additional measures of strategic deterrence.
Moscow has strongly criticized the deliveries of Western weapons to Ukraine, accusing the U.S. and its allies of fueling the conflict.
The Russian military says the Kinzhal has a range of up to 2,000 kilometers about 1,250 miles and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept. Russia has used the weapon to strike several targets in Ukraine.
