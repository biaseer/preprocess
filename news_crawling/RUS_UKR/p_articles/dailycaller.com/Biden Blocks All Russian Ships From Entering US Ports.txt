President Joe Biden announced Thursday that Russian-affiliated ships will be banned from entering U.S. ports due to the countrys invasion of Ukraine.
That means no ship, no ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by a Russian entity, will be allowed to dock in a United States port or access our shores. None, the president said Thursday, according to the outlet. He cited the ongoing premeditated, unjustified, unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation as justification for the move.

The order will not ban the shipment of all Russian cargo through U.S. ports and was designed to minimize impact on already-strained supply chains, Reuters reported. Bidens decision comes after similar bans were put into place by Canada and several European governments.

Vessels that are Russian-owned, flagged or operated will be prevented from coming into U.S. ports, Bidens order said. Russian ships account for about 3 of traffic in American ports, according to Reuters.
The ship ban is only the latest sanction to hit Russia from the Biden administration since the war in Ukraine began. Russian aircraft are already banned from flying through American-controlled airspace, and the U.S. recently stopped the import of all Russian oil.
