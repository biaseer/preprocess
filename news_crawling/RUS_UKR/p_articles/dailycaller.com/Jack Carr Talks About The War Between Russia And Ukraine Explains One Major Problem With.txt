Theyre not getting honest assessments, Carr explained when talking about how dictators and authoritarians are often not given accurate information from senior leaders. That lack of information can lead to disasters on the ground.
Let us know in the comments why you think Russia failed to topple the Ukrainian government as many predicted, and make sure to keep checking back for our latest clips!
I think Carr hit this one right on the head. Is a lack of information the only reason why Russia is struggling? I dont know, but I 100 believe that Putins generals might fear telling him the truth.
I spoke with former Navy SEAL and author JackCarrUSA about Alec Baldwin allegedly shooting a woman, and he shared a great message about basic gun safety and responsibility.
Again, people expected Russia to roll right into Kyiv. That never happened, and it looks like its no longer going to happen.
I sat down with the former Navy SEAL and awesome author, and I couldnt pass up the opportunity to ask about the war going down in Ukraine. Specifically, I asked about the predictions Russia would roll Kyiv in a matter of days. He had a very interesting response!
