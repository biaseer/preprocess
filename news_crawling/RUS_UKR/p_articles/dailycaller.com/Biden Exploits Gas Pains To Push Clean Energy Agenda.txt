The argument that you should go to one resource over another isnt obvious to American consumers. American consumers are not energy experts. They know what they pay, they know what they earn, and by and large if energy is more expensive, theyre not going to be enthusiastic about hearing about big, new spending on any conduit from anyone, Brook told the Caller.
The transition is likely to be long, Book said. It could potentially be extensive, and in any case its not going to be an immediate solution. One of the challenges of the present is that for anybody whose running for office, or trying to defend their partys majority in the Congress  theres no electric vehicles coming to the rescue in months.
And, you know, if you drive an electric car, this would not be affecting you, clearly, Granholm added.
Ultimately, though, it remains to be seen whether Americans  currently concerned over gas prices  will jump at the Biden administrations plan. Brook, for one, argued that the current climate may mean people are less willing to consider the shift.
Ultimately, Tubb argued that the presidents proposal is incredibly naive, citingEurope as one example of an area of the world that has been pursuing this for over 30 years now.

Even if all of the oil we use in the U.S.A. were made in the U.S.A., the price of it is still subject to powers and dynamics outside of the U.S.A, Buttigieg said. Which means that until we achieve a form of energy independence that is based on clean energy created here at home, American citizens will still be vulnerable to wild price hikes like we are seeing right now.
Theyre trying to frame the current crisis as an argument for wind and solar and electric vehicles, for this vision that they have for the energy sector, Tubb added.
It should motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy, Biden said at the time. This is a perspective, as I said, that our European allies share and the  a future where together we can achieve greater independence. RELATED: How Biden Raised Gas Prices Without Anyone Noticing
Though Biden is perhaps the most notable, he is not alone in pushing for a transition to clean energy as Americans see higher gas prices. RELATED:Biden Promises Lower Gas Prices After Emergency Reserve Release, Suggests Up To 35 Cents Lower
The cost of being a true energy island and cutting ourselves off from the world using only our own resources with no contact with the world would be much, much higher than the price were paying now, Book also said.
Imagine a future: the freight trucks that deliver bread and milk to our grocery store shelves and the buses that take children to school and parents to work, Harris said at the press conference. Imagine all the heavy-duty vehicles that keep our supply lines strong and allow our economy to grow. Imagine that they produce zero emissions.
I mean, we obviously are all in on making sure that we meet the Presidents goals of getting to 100 clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, Granholm said during a press briefing when pressed on how acute issues with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack would speed up the administrations efforts to move into a renewable direction.
On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki also used the countrys gas pains as evidence that the U.S. must achieve energy independence that reduces demand for oil and bolsters our clean energy economy.
On March 8, Biden announced a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil as a result of Russias invasion of Ukraine. While the president sympathized with Americans struggling amid high gas prices  noting that the decision today is not without cost here at home and promising to minimize the impact  he also made a point to highlight how todays current gas crisis is evidence that the U.S. should become energy independent.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Vice President Kamala Harris held a joint press conference March 7 to push the administrations green energy plan. The two used the press conference to, in part, tout a $3.7 billion investment into new electric buses.
The administration has, as Tubb noted, been pushing for clean energy throughout Bidens time in office. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, for example, declared in May 2021 that Americans wouldnt be affected by high gas prices if they drove an electric car.
Amid soaring gas prices and a new ban on imports of Russian oil, President Joe Bidens administration remains focused on promoting its clean energy agenda, even pointing to the current crisis as reason why the change must be made.

Kevin Book, a senior associate of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Daily Caller that while energy will likely change in the future, the administrations efforts to move over to clean energy is unlikely to help Americans who are struggling now.
Buttigieg made similar comments April 4, when he suggested that Americans may continue seeing high gas prices until the country can achieve a form of energy independence that is based on clean energy created here at home.
She made the connection in a statement touting Bidens recent historic decision to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of 1 million barrels a day for six months  an initiative announced by the administration at the end of March in an effort to lower gas prices.
Loosening environmental regulations or pulling back clean energy investment wont  let me explain  will not lower energy prices for families. But transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy with tax credits to help American families winterize their homes and use less energy, that will  that will help, the president added.
Katie Tubb, aresearch fellow for energy and environmental issues at the Heritage Foundation, noted that the administration has been consistent in its push for clean energy.
Even in this current situation, he Biden is framing it as that much more of a reason why we should be following his agenda for energy policy and a re-engineeringof the energy sector, Tubb said, noting that shes been a little surprised that they havent changed course at all.
