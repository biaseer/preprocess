The deal was struck by Swedish distribution company Eccho Rights, which handles licensing for the script and original version of the show.
Servant of the People, the comedy series that helped to launch the political career of its creator and now Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, is being remade in Poland by free-to-air network Polsat.
Created by and starring Zelensky, the original series was produced by Studio Kvartal 95 and broke records for Ukrainian network 11. Zelenskys political party was also named Servant of the People and he went on to launch a successful presidential campaign in 2019.
This is a hugely powerful script  a comedy but one that spoke so deeply to the Ukrainian people that it changed the course of political history in that country, and subsequently the world. Naturally we cant wait to see what the future holds for the Polish version, said Berkin Nalbantl, Eccho Rights sales and acquisitions executive for CEE and Africa.
The Polish adaptation, titled Suga Narodu, is already in production and will see TV actor Marcin Hycnar play the part of an ordinary man who is unwittingly voted president. Polot Media is producing the remake, with Maciej Bieliski directing.
Following Russias invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, interest in the series surged as networks across the globe looked to acquire the rights.
For Eccho Rights, the announcement of the deal comes one month after it was acquired by Germany-based financing and coproduction company Night Train Media. Eccho Rights is continuing to operate as an independent brand within Night Train, with CEO Fredrik af Malmborg remaining at the helm.
