DAVOS, Switzerland AP  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed hopes for global cooperation on climate change, hunger and war as dozens of climate activists demonstrated in the Swiss town of Davos. Both came on the last day of the World Economic Forums meeting of global elites. It ended Thursday with many words but little concrete action to solve the worlds most pressing crises. The Davos gathering has been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine, rising food and fuel prices, and signs that governments arent doing enough to fight global warming. That has doused many moods in the face of a can-do spirit by many innovators and entrepreneurs in Davos.
