BUDAPEST, Hungary AP  A diplomatic conflict between Hungary and Ukraine has deepened. The two countries summoned each others ambassadors Tuesday over Budapests decision to sign a long-term contract to purchase Russian gas. Ukraine considers Hungarys 15-year deal with Russian gas company Gazprom a blow to its economic and national security interests. The agreement will see the import of an annual 4.5 billion cubic meters of gas to Hungary through lines that bypass Ukraine and deprive it of lucrative transit fees. Ukraines Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Monday saying Kyiv was surprised and disappointed by Hungarys deal with Russia. Hungarys foreign minister said Ukraine was interfering in his countrys internal affairs.
