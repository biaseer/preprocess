COPENHAGEN, Denmark AP  Danish brewery group Carlsberg is pulling out of Russia, citing Moscows ongoing war against Ukraine. The Copenhagen-based group said Monday it had taken the difficult and immediate decision to seek a full disposal of our business in Russia. Its CEO said the decision means Carlsberg will have no presence in Russia. The company says its Russian business will be treated as an asset held for sale until completion of the disposal. Carlsberg generates around 10 of its sales in Russia, and has about 8,400 staff, who will be laid off. Heineken is also leaving Russia but will pay its 1,800 staff in Russia through the end of the year.
