Estonian nationals who are in Ukraine and wish to leave are advised to leave the country at the earliest opportunity and return to Estonia. We ask you to not wait for evacuation and look for ways to leave the country independently. Ukraines airspace is closed and westbound land transport must be used. Our recommendation is to choose a member state of the European Union for crossing the border. If necessary, you can contact us by calling the 247 emergency number 372 5301 9999.
Due to Russias war in Ukraine, we advise against any travel to Ukraine. However, if you have decided to still go to Ukraine despite the ongoing war, please keep in mind that the assistance capabilities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are limited.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has information about nearly 200 Estonian citizens who have registered their stay in Ukraine with us and have left Ukraine. We urge all Estonian nationals in Ukraine to register their stay at the Reisi Targalt website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or email emailprotected
