Since November 2021, Kiev and some Western countries have accused Russia of assembling heavy troops near the Ukrainian border with a possible intention of "invasion".
Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusation, stressing its right to mobilise troops within its borders to defend its territory as the NATO activities constitute a threat to Russia's border security.
While commenting on the prospects of Ukraine's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO, which has been one of the main concerns of Russia, Zelensky said that not all NATO members support Ukraine's accession.
