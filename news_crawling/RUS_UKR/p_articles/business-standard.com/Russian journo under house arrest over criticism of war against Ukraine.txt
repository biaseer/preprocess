Under Russian law, Moscow's war on Ukraine can only be referred to as a special military operation and penalties for criticizing the army's actions were made tougher in March.

Ovsyannikova has only been issued with fines on the smaller end of the scale so far.
It is part of a criminal case against 44-year-old Ovsyannikova for the alleged spreading of false information about Russian armed forces.
Ovsyannikova worked for Russian state television's Channel One and had been considered loyal to the Kremlin until she held an anti-war banner up to the camera in a news broadcast in March.
Russian news agencies reported the decision by a Moscow court on Thursday, reports dpa news agency.
The banner read: "Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda. You are being lied to here."
Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, whose residence was raided earlier this week, has been put under house arrest until October 9 over her criticism of Moscow's ongoing war against Ukraine.
