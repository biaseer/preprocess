On April 13, Ukrainian ground forces reportedly fired two Neptune anti-ship missiles at the Russian missile cruiser, Moskva, igniting a fire that eventually sank the iconic flagship of the Russian Navys Black Sea Fleet. It is being argued that the ageing ships radar systems were not working properly and that US intelligence provided the Ukrainian military with targeting data, which enabled it to strike the Moskva with lethal accuracy. The humiliation was compounded when, three days ago, a second Russian warship was reportedly hit and sunk at Snake Island, near Odessa. With the Russia-Ukraine war in its third month, Kyiv says 25,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives fighting stubborn Ukrainian military resistance. Moscow, however, puts its military casualties at 1,300 and civilian casualties at about 3,000.
