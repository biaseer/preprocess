The Twitter account of the Embassy in London has been actively disseminating false information about ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine.
Responding to a photo of the woman in the aftermath of Wednesday's attack, the Embassy had tweeted: "She has some very realistic make-up. She is also doing well with her beauty blogs. Plus she could not be in the maternity house at the time of the strike, as it has long been taken by the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion who told all the staff to clear the place."
