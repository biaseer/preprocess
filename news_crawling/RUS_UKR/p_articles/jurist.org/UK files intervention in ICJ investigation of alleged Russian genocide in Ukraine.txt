The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Friday filed a declaration ofintervention in the International Court of Justice ICJ in the case of Ukraine v. Russian Federation. Human rights experts in Ukraine and across the world have accused Russia of genocide during its invasion of Ukraine. Until today, the UK has declined to intervene or officially label Russian aggression in Ukraine a genocide.
In accordance with Article 83 of the Rules of Court, Ukraine and the Russian Federation have been invited to furnish written observations on the United Kingdoms declaration of intervention.
The UK believes the case raises important issues concerning the Genocide Convention and that it has a direct interest in the construction that might be placed upon provisions of the Convention by the Court in the proceedings.
