The founder of SpaceX, Elon Musk, on Saturday, said that his company's Starlink internet services have been activated in Ukraine. The move came after Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov urged the American businessman to provide Starlink stations in war-hit Ukraine where internet services were disrupted following military operations by Russia.
The array of Starlink satellites, operated by SpaceX, offer low-latency internet coverage in remote areas of several countries. Notably, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized Ukraine's breakaway regions - Donetsk and Luhansk - as independent entities. Following this, he ordered special military operations "to protect" the people in the Donbas region.
