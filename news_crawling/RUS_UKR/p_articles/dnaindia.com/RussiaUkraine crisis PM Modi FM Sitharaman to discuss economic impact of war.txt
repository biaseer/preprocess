Russian forces fired missiles at several cities in Ukraine and landed troops on its coast on Thursday, officials and media said, after President Vladimir Putin authorised what he called a special military operation.
Meanwhile, the Ukraine envoy to India Igor Polikha sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention amid the Russian invasion. Urging PM Modi to take steps to solve the crisis, Igor Polikha said, "India has a special relationship with Russia and New Delhi can play a more active role in controlling the situation."
Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet finance minister and other officials on Thursday evening to discuss the economic impact of Russia-Ukraine crisis and ways to mitigate the impact of rising crude oil prices, a government source told Reuters.
Earlier, the Indian embassy in Ukraine said that special flights arranged to head to Kyiv to pick up Indian nationals were cancelled as the countrys airspace was closed.
