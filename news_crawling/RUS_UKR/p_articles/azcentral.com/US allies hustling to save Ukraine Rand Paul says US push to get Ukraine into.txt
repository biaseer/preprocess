The exchange sparked some barbs at Paul on Twitter from critics suggesting he was embracing Putins line.

Recent security incidents ina Russian-backed separatist region of Moldovahave raised the U.N.'s concerns and thrusted the sliver of land known asTransnistria into the headlines of the Ukraine war coverage.
Officials in Poland and Bulgaria, both members of NATO and the EU, said Tuesday that Russia is suspending their countries natural gas deliveries after they refused to pay for their suppliesin rubles.
Explosions rang out Monday and Tuesday inTransnistria, a territory of nearly 500,000 people alongside the southwestern Ukrainian border that broke away from Moldova during the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.
The British Defense Ministry saysRussias decision to besiege rather than attack the plant means many Russian units cannot be redeployed elsewhere in the country. "Ukraines defense of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness," the British assessment says.
Transnistria has not been recognized by any country, but the presence of 1,500 Russian troops andan estimated 20,000 tons of Soviet-eraweapons, ammunition and explosives within its land have led to longstanding worries that it could be used as a launching point for a Russian invasioninto Ukraine or Moldova. Such an aggression at this pointcould further expand the war.
Lavrov also accused NATO of fighting a proxy war and pouring oil on the fire with its support for Ukraine, a notion rejected by BritishPrime Minister Boris Johnson inan interview with British station Talk TV.Russia has singled out Britain for criticism after a U.K. government minister said it was legitimate for Ukraine to hit fuel depots in Russia with U.K.-supplied weapons.

HOW PUTIN AMASSED HIS FORTUNE:A port city, a steel cage, a palace: The steps that made Putin 'the richest man in the world'
Asked for his assessment of whats happening in Russia, Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putins propaganda system is hard to penetrate, but citizens are increasingly feeling the effects of sanctions. Still, I think what were seeing is the Russian people, to the extent that theyre informed, continue to support for the most part President Putin, he said.
Before 2022, the highest level of support for refugees entering the U.S. was forallowing "several hundred ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo" in 1999, when 66 approved. The only other time a majority of Americans were in favor of the proposed refugees entering the U.S. was in 2018 when 51 supported "several thousand" entering from Honduras and other central American countries.
Paul, a non-interventionist, blamed the U.S., including the Biden administration, for beating the drums to admit Ukraine to NATO even though Putin described that as a red line.Had Ukraine joined NATO, Paul continued, we may still have the destruction, but we would also have troops in Ukraine.

Heappey also dismisseda top Russian diplomat's assertion that the danger of a nuclear conflict is "serious" and "real."Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the statements on Russian TV, accusing Ukrainian leaders and NATO of provoking Russia by "pouringoil on the fire" with the advanced weaponry. Heappey said the likelihood of nuclear war is"vanishingly small" since it would not be in the best interestsof any country.

He said meetings similar to the one Tuesday will be held once a month, either virtually or in person.Before the meeting, Austin had promised to "keep moving heaven and earth" to support Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies have committed more than$5 billion worth of equipment to Ukraine's defense, he said.
Russia continues to isolate itself, its economy is in tatters, its military has been depleted in many ways  they are a weaker military, they are a weaker state right now, Kirby said in an interview with CNN. We don't want to see Russia able to conduct this kind of invasion again in the future.
Mariupol is drawing global notice, butlocal officials said at least nine people were killed and several more wounded by Russian attacks elsewhere in eastern and southern Ukraine. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region, said Russian forces continue to deliberately fire at civilians and to destroy critical infrastructure.
"It's the reality we're seeing, the surreal reality. That's what really worries a lot of people," said Olena Khorenjenko, 33, a Ukrainian refugee who fled to Moldova and is familiar with Transnistria.
For all the carnage that Russias brutal invasion continues to inflict, Ukraine was and will continue to be a free and independent country, he said. It's impossible not to be moved by what the Ukrainians have achieved.
