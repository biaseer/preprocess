The brand's founder,Yuri Shefler, said the factors behind the decision includehis "vehement position" on the regimeof Russian President Vladimir Putin and "the desire to accurately representStoli'sroots in Latvia."
Stoli Group Global CEO Damian McKinney said the company's employees, partners and distributors are asking the brand to take a stand.
The most popular vodkas in the U.S.  includingSmirnoff, Ciroc, Tito's, Absolut, Svedka, Grey Goose, SKYY and New Amsterdam are not made in Russia but are made in Sweden, France, the U.K. and the U.S.
Stoli Vodka's production facilities have been located inLatvia since Shefler was exiled, the company said. AfterRussia'sinvasion ofUkraine, Stoli said it would engage exclusively with "Slovakian sources to further ensure 100 non-Russian alpha grade spirit."
"While I have been exiled fromRussiasince 2000 due to my opposition to Putin, I have remained proud of the Stolichnaya brand," Shefler said in a statement, adding the name no longer represents the organization. "More than anything, I wish for 'Stoli' to represent peace inEuropeand solidarity withUkraine."
Amid the invasion, businesses have been pulling Russian vodka brandsfrom store shelves and some bars have been pouring out the liquor.
