A similar resolution was passed unanimously Tuesday by the Orange County Board of Supervisors. It encourages the county to sever ties with any Russian-backed bank or financial institution. The county currently doesnt have any direct investments in Russia.
The resolution, which also urges international divestment of holdings in Russia, passed on a 14-0 vote.
In Los Angeles, members of the City Council expressed support for Ukraine, denounced horrific acts against humanity and expressed concern that history is repeating itself.
Whats happening in Ukraine right now is close to home for me, Councilmember Paul Koretz said.
My mothers family fled Kyiv a hundred years ago to avoid the Russian pogroms, and Ive been sick to my stomach seeing the photos of innocent men, women and especially children who have been murdered in this invasion, he said.
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a resolution condemning the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin in waging war against Ukraine.
