The Russian troops panicked at the first sign of illness, which showed up very quickly, and began to prepare to leave, the operator said. The claim couldnt be independently verified.
LVIV, Ukraine AP  Russian troops were leaving the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and heading towards Ukraines border with Belarus, the Ukrainian nuclear operator company said.
The operator, Energoatom said that the Russian military was also preparing to leave Slavutych, a nearby city where power plant workers live.
It turns out that the occupiers guarded the station for more than five weeks, and even so well that there are no complaints, Energoatom said in a statement on Telegram.
Energoatom said the Russians have signed a document confirming the handover of the Chernobyl plant and stating that the plants administration doesnt have any complaints about the Russian troops who were guarding the facility.
Energoatom also said reports were confirmed that the Russians dug trenches in the Red Forest, the 10-square-kilometer nearly four-square-mile area surrounding the Chernobyl plant within the Exclusion Zone, and received significant doses of radiation.
