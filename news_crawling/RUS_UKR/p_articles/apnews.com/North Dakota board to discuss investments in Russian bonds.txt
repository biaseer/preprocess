North Dakota stands with the freedom-loving people of Ukraine in opposition to the ongoing attacks by Russian armed forces and President Putin, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said. We must do our part to limit the financial resources at Russias disposal to discourage these unprovoked and heinous acts of aggression.
Lawmakers passed a bill last session aimed at creating a broader investment policy for the Legacy Fund. The legislation sets targets for 10 of the funds principal to be invested in equity investments in the state and 10 in fixed income investments within the state.
Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford, chairman of the board that includes the state treasurer and insurance commissioner, said the situation is fluid and additional guidance is forthcoming. Much of the Legacy Fund is invested in other countries.
