Vucic praised Russia for supporting Serbia in the UN Security Council by blocking resolutions that would have allowed its former province of Kosovo to join international institutions.
Vucic said that Serbia regards the violation of Ukraines territorial integrity as very wrong, but added it wont join in the sanctions.
BELGRADE, Serbia AP  Serbia rejected calls Friday from the European Union and the U.S. to join sanctions against Russia, citing its national interests, although its autocratic president did say that Moscows assault on Ukraine is against international law.
The Republic of Serbia expresses most sincere regret over what is happening in Ukraine, Vucic told reporters. Both Russia and Ukraine are friendly countries.
Despite formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has been strengthening ties with its traditional Slavic ally Russia. Moscow has been supplying Serbias armed forces with weapons, leading to more tensions in the Balkans which went through a bloody civil war in the 1990s.
He described the decision as serious and responsible, adding that not joining sanctions against Russia is fair because of Moscows supports Serbias bid to retain claim on Kosovo.
With the move, Serbia remained a rare European state  like Russian ally Belarus  not to join a call for Western sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of a sovereign European state.
Serbia respects the norms of international law, President Aleksandar Vucic said. But Serbia also understands its own interests.
Naturally, Serbia remains on its European path and this is its strategic determination, but Serbia wont rush into hostilities only because someone wants it to, Vucic said.
