Bars and stores in other parts of the U.S. have also stopped selling Russian alcohol as a way to protest events in Ukraine.
The move by Gov. Spencer Cox was in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine and mirrors moves by governors of other states.
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu also signed an executive order requiring state liquor outlets to remove Russian-made and branded alcohol. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine directed the states Commerce Department to cease the purchase and sale of Russian Standard, the only Russian vodka sold in Ohio under the brand names Green Mark and Russian Standard.
Russias ruthless attack on a sovereign nation is an egregious violation of human rights, Cox said in a statement announcing the executive order. Utah stands in solidarity with Ukraine and will not support Russian enterprises, no matter how small the exchange.
