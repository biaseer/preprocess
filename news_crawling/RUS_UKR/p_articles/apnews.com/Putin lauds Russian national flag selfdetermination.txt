Putin also said that Russian schools beginning in September will open their school weeks with flag-raising ceremonies and singing of the national anthem.
MOSCOW AP  President Vladimir Putin on Monday lauded Russias flag as a symbol of a country that is determined to defend its interests and remain loyal to traditional values.
In a video address marking National Flag Day, Putin did not mention Russias six-month-old military operation in Ukraine, but echoed some of the justifications cited for sending in troops.
The desire to live according to ones will, to choose ones own path and follow it, has become part of the genetic code of our people, he said. We are firm in pursuing in the international arena only those policies that meet the fundamental interests of the motherland.
Putin and other officials have said Russia sent troops into Ukraine as effectively a protective measure against the encroaching West.
