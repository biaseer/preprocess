Zelenskyy on Tuesday said in a video address that Ukraine would never start a war, but would always stand until the end and offered a proposal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet in eastern Ukraine to defuse tensions.
The new law, passed by Ukraines parliament in late March, will allow the country to quickly equip the military units of all state defense forces with reservists, thereby significantly increasing their combat effectiveness during military aggression, Zelenskyys office said in a statement.
The move comes amid a massive Russian troop buildup near Ukrainian borders and a flareup of cease-fire violations in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russia-backed separatists since 2014.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said he wasnt sure Putin had time to look at Zelenskyys address.
Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the buildup, arguing that its free to deploy its forces and stressing that they dont threaten anyone. At the same time, the Kremlin has warned Ukrainian authorities against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel east, saying that Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Tuesday that the Russian buildup across the border is continuing and is expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops in about a week and urged the West to beef up sanctions against Moscow by targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy.
KYIV, Ukraine AP  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a law allowing to call up reservists for military service without announcing a mobilization, his office said Wednesday.
