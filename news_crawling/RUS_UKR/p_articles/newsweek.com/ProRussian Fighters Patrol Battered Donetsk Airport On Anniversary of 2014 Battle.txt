Following the 2014 "Revolution of Dignity" in Ukraine, the First Battle of Donetsk Airport took place on May 26 and May 27 between the DPR and Ukrainian government forces.
After a Ukrainian victory, the DPR retook the airport during the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport between September 28, 2014, and January 21, 2015.
From February 24 to May 26, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 29,600 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The DPR People's Militia released a statement on May 25 declaring: "Servicemen of the NM DPR defend the republic's borders: Donetsk Airport.
The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,315 tanks, 3,235 armored fighting vehicles, 617 artillery systems, 201 multiple launch rocket systems, 93 anti-aircraft systems, 206 warplanes, 170 helicopters, 2,225 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, 13 vessels, 502 unmanned aerial vehicles, 47 units of special equipment, and 114 cruise missiles.
They added that five civilians died, 12 were wounded and 47 civilian sites were destroyed or damaged in the latest attacks.
In other developments, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces have attacked more than 40 towns in the eastern Donbas region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Wednesday that makes it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become citizens of Russia.
"Servicemen of the People's Militia adamantly stand in positions protecting the people of the DPR from the invasion of the occupying forces of Ukraine and give a proportional response to fire provocation."
A video shows fighters of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic DPR patrolling the battered Donetsk Airport on the anniversary of the first battle in 2014.
The following day, the militia said: "On the eve of the anniversary of the Ukrainian attack on the Donetsk airport, after which the life of the Donetsk people was divided into 'before and after,' the fighters of the legendary Sparta battalion spoke about the storming of the airport."
Russia has also done away with the upper age limit for contractual service in its military.
The Donetsk People's Republic is a breakaway state located in Ukraine and was formed by pro-Russian separatists following the "Revolution of Dignity." DPR fighters, as well as those from the Luhansk People's Republic, also formed in 2014, have been fighting alongside Russian troops since the invasion began February 24 in what the Kremlin is still calling a "special military operation."
Ukraine has called Russia's offer to lift the blockade of its Black Sea ports in return for the lifting of some sanctions "blackmail."
