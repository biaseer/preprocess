"Fire is conducted at ranges up to 30 kilometers both from closed firing positions and direct fire without preliminary preparation of the positions.
The MoD said Friday: "This footage shows combat work of crews of 152-mm 'Msta-S' self-propelled howitzers when performing firing operations to destroy armored vehicles and fortified positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Russian Ministry of Defense footage purports to show troops carrying out "special military operations" with Msta self-propelled howitzers able to inflict maximum damage on Ukrainian fortified positions.
The Russian MoD said in a statement on June 1 that its Yars mobile missile systems, which can carry nuclear warheads and which boast a reported range of over 10,000 kilometers 6,200 miles, were performing "intensive maneuvering operations on combat patrol routes in the Ivanovo Region", east of the Russian capital Moscow.
This comes after President Joe Biden said he will send Kyiv more advanced rocket systems that will help to strike enemy forces from a longer distance. These rocket systems have double the range of the rocket systems used by Russian forces and are said to be much more accurate.
"High-explosive projectiles are used to destroy fortifications, which allow inflicting maximum damage to them, including deep concrete enemy fortifications."
Zenger News contacted Russian and Ukrainian officials for comment but had not received a reply at the time of writing.
From February 24 to June 2, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 30,850 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The Russian military said troops used 2S19 Msta 152.4-mm self-propelled howitzers designed by the Soviet Union to blast Ukrainian targets.
Analysts say over 70 percent of the city of Sievierodonetsk is now controlled by invading Russian forces, with almost all critical infrastructure and housing destroyed.
The MoD said the howitzers, which first entered service in 1989, pack a punch and can strike at distances up to 30 kilometers 18 miles with no preliminary preparation needed before arranging them in position to fire.
Russian troops invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin is still calling a "special military operation." June 3 marks the 100th day of the campaign.
The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,363 tanks, 3,354 armored fighting vehicles, 661 artillery systems, 207 multiple launch rocket systems, 95 anti-aircraft systems, 210 warplanes, 175 helicopters, 2,325 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, 13 vessels, 521 unmanned aerial vehicles, 51 units of special equipment, and 120 cruise missiles.
