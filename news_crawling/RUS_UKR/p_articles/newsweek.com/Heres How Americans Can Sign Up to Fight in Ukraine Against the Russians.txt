The United States may not send troops into Ukraine during the war against Russia, but it doesn't mean Americans can't join the fight in Ukraine. Officials in the U.S. have stated the Ukrainian military has done a stellar job at holding off Russian forces so far, but this could be a long war, and Ukraine is asking for help from foreign allies.
Many veterans contacted the Military Times news service, asking how they can join the fight. Here are six things needed before veterans and everyday Americans can join the fight in Ukraine.
A senior U.S. defense official told the Associated Press on Sunday that the Russians have been slowed down and frustrated.
Russia began an attack on Ukraine late last week, and it has carried through the weekend and into Monday morning in Eastern Europe. Though Ukraine has fought vigilantly to protect their land, Russia has an overwhelming amount of forces that can still enter the country.
"They have been stymied, and they have been resisted by Ukrainians, and to some degree, they've done it to themselves in terms of their fuel and logistics and sustainment problems," the official told AP. "But as I said earlier, we would expect them to learn from these issues and adapt to them and try to overcome them. So I think we all need to be very sober here. in recognizing that this is combat, and combat is ugly, it's messy, it's bloody, and it's not wholly predictable."
Ukraine has ordered all men its country to stay and fight, and police departments have handed out weapons to those staying to fight.
"The International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine" was created by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to help strengthen the fight against the Russian invasion.
