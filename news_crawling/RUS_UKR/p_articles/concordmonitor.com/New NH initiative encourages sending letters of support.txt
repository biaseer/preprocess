While the conflict in Ukraine continues, the New Hampshire Ukraine Relief Fund is incentivizing people to write support letters to citizens in that country.
Additionally, the city is working with the Manchester School District to gather messages from youth.
The New Hampshire Ukraine Relief Fund, launched earlier this week by the Granite United Way, was created to send monetary support and new and used items to that country. The organizers thought it would be a nice touch to include notes along with the donations.
The City of Manchester has partnered with the fund to have a letter drop-off point located at City Hall. Mayor Joyce Craig said shed write one too, and explained they would be sent next month.
The fund will also send medical supply donations to thousands of Ukrainians still seeking shelter. Craig hopes these messages of hope and peace can let Ukrainians know people worldwide are thinking about them.
Granite Staters looking to send messages to Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion can now send them through the New Hampshire Ukraine Relief Fund. The group will be receiving the letters until May 2.
