Another foreign policy fiasco is unfolding in Ukraine, where we are engaged in a new Cold War with Russia. Its a truism that war is natures way of teaching the U.S. geography. In this case, Kiev and Moscow are less than 500 miles apart. How would we respond if Russia sponsored a coup in Mexico and then supplied them with military hardware? Unmentioned in most U.S. media accounts of Ukraine is the U.S. sponsored coup in Ukraine on February 22, 2014. With the aid of far-right Neo-Nazis, we violently overthrew democratically-elected President Viktor Yanukovych.
The coup was instigated and choreographed by Victoria Nuland, now Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. Nuland recently appeared on PBS News Hour to explain the Ukraine crisis. Curiously, she made no mention of any coup, only of the subsequent invasion of eastern Ukraine by Russia. About that invasion, most of the population there is ethnically Russian and was threatened with ethnic cleansing by Ukrainian Neo-Nazis after the coup. Russia intervened to protect this population. The U.S. also claimed that Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, but Russia already had troops stationed there under an agreement with Ukraine. The Kremlin has made clear that it regards Ukraine as a fundamental security concern, and that efforts to make that country a de facto NATO member by arming it with sophisticated weaponry, as we are doing, are folly. We need a different path before the Ukraine conflict turns into an entirely avoidable conflagration.
