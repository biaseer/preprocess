I was heartened to learn that the Welsh Government agrees that the asylum system is broken and that the UK Governments Nationality and Borders Bill, currently being debated in the Houses of Parliament, severely undermines our vision of Wales as a Nation of Sanctuary.
The Welsh government condemns the Bills proposal to open detention centres, euphemistically called accommodation centres in Wales as well as the rest of the UK, pointing out that this will undermine our Nation of Sanctuary vision.
The statement ends with a reaffirmation with which I fully agree: Wales is a welcoming nation and we will always stand with those who need us the most. We want the UK Government to change course and to advance  not diminish  the legal, equitable and moral standing of the United Kingdom.
We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues. The ability to comment on our stories is a privilege, not a right, however, and that privilege may be withdrawn if it is abused or misused.
Every country needs to take their fair share of refugees and to treat them fairly and with compassion rather than turning them away or locking them up as if they were criminals.
The plight of refugees is becoming more and more obvious to us all as the illegal Russian war with Ukraine causes more people to seek refuge and as climate chaos makes more places unsafe.
