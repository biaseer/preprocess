Scholz was apparently referring to the June 2021 summit in Brussels, when NATO endorsed the two former Soviet republics right to join in principle, but did not give a timeframe for accession and insisted on both undergoingreformsbefore that could happen.

That was the correct decision, after very long negotiations within NATO about that issue,said Scholz, answering ZDF host Maybrit Illner.
