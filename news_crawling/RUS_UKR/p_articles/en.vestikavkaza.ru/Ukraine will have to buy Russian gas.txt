We take gas from the transit pipe, and when Nord Stream 2 starts working, and it will start working this year, we wont have gas in the transit pipe either. The only way out for our government is to switch to direct contracts with Gazprom, Korneichuk is sure, RIA Novosti reports.
The political leadership of Ukraine artificially created the current energy crisis in order to explain to citizens the need to start buying blue fuel from Russia - Kiev purposefully raised gas tariffs in the country and "put business on its knees," the political scientist is sure: "This is a banal political technology - Ukrainians will say: yes, you can negotiate with anyone - just lower our gas tariffs," Dmitry Korneychuk concluded.
The country has already faced a catastrophic shortage of blue fuel, and in the next heating season Kiev "will have no placeto buy gas", because of which the authorities will be forced to commit the "greatest betrayal".
Ukraine will have tostart direct gas supplies from Russia after the opening of "Nord Stream-2", political analyst Dmitry Korneychuk suggested on the air of the NewsOne TV channel.
