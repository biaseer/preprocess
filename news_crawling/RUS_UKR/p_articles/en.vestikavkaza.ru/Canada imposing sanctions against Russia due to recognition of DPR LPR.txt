Sanctions will remain in force until Ukraines territorial integrity is restored, PM said, adding that it was "not too late" for Russia to seek a diplomatic resolution.
The Canadian government will also sanction members of the Russian parliament who voted for the decision to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk as independent, as well as apply additional sanctions on two state-backed Russian banks and prevent any financial dealings with them, he added.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a first round of economic sanctions on Russia due to Moscows decision to recognize the Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples Republics.
The government will ban Canadians from all financial dealings with the so-called independent states of Luhansk and Donetsk, as well as from engaging in purchases of Russian sovereign debt, Trudeau told a press conference on Tuesday.
