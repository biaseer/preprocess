U.S. President Joe Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart Vladimir Zelensky about Washingtons intentions to introduce sanctions against Moscow due to Russias recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples Republics DPR and LPR, the White House press service reported.
According to it, "President Biden strongly condemned Russian President Putins decision to purportedly recognize the "independence" of the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine" and "reiterated that the United States would respond swiftly and decisively, in lock-step with its Allies and partners, to further Russian aggression against Ukraine."
On February 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the sovereignty of the DPR and LPR. Agreements on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance were signed with their leaders.
