"Lawmakers believe that the recognition of DPR and LPR will create the grounds for ensuring security guarantees and protecting the population of the republics from external threats, as well as strengthening international peace and regional stability in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and will initiate the process of international recognition of both states", Volodin said on Telegram.
Russias State Duma backed a resolution calling for diplomatic recognition of Donbas and Lugansk Peoples Republics, raising tensions between Russia and Ukraine another notch, even as Russian troops began a partial withdrawal from the Ukrainian border.
According to speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, the lower house of the Russian Parliament on Tuesday voted in favour of sending a resolution on the recognition of the self-proclaimed Donbass republics to President Vladimir Putin.
Volodin also stressed that Kiev disregards the Minsk agreements, saying that Russians living in Donbass require help and support.
