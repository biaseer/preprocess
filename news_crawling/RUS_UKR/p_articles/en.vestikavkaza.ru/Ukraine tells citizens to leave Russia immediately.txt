Ukraine has warned its citizens not to travel to Russia, and advised any Ukrainians currently in Russia to leave immediately.
We emphasize that ignoring these recommendations will significantly complicate ensuring proper protection of Ukrainian citizens in the Russian Federation, the ministry added.
In a travel advisory issued on Wednesday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said the intensification of Russian aggression against Ukraine  may lead to significant restrictions on the provision of consular assistance in the Russian Federation.
