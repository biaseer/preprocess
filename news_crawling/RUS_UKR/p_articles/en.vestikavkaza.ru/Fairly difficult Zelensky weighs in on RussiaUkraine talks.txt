"First of all, negotiations are still in progress. The negotiations are fairly difficult," Zelensky noted.
The Ukrainian leader stressed that "any war could be finished at the table of negotiations". At the same time, he did not comment on the information that appeared earlier in the media about the alleged conditions of a possible agreement between the parties.
Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are quite difficult, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said in an interview with the NBC TV Channel.
