Ukraine's blue and yellow flag is displayed with other flags on the ceiling of the Direct Relief warehouse in Goleta.
Tighe said it seems fitting since the nonprofits late founder, William Zimdin, escaped Hitler and sent relief parcels to to world war two survivors rebuilding the same region.
Direct Relief had already been sending COVID-19 aid to Ukraine, and oxygen concentrators will soon be on the way as well.
"It is really an honor and we are so grateful to the Santa Barbara community for supporting our organization for decades," said Cooper.
Tighe said it will help the wounded and people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes.
The orange backpacks contain triage equipment such as tourniquets and wound care supplies paid for by people who care.
Direct Relief CEO and president Thomas Tighe said, They wanted our entire stock so we are sending the first wave outtoday.
Direct Relief is not using the conflict to ask for donations, but there is a donation link on its website.

SANTA BARBARA COUNTY, Calif. -- Pallets wrapped in white plastic are full of Direct Relief emergency medical backpacks ready to be shipped to Ukraine.
"We lost communications for a couple of days, it came back on Saturday afternoon, that allowed us the last few days to get a better sense of what they are looking at."
About 400 medical backpacks that can also be carried like duffle bags will be flown out of Los Angeles and met by a Ukraine Ministry of Health Contact.
