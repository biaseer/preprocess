TALLINN, Estonia AP  Frances defense ministry says its armed forces have conducted a hastily organized military exercise in Estonia. The airborne operation dubbed Thunder Lynx was executed at a very short notice, dropping about 100 French paratroopers over an area in the Baltic country secured by Estonian soldiers, the statement said. The surprise drill in Estonia, a NATO ally and Russias neighbor, was conducted Tuesday night as an act of strategic solidarity as war in Ukraine rages into the fifth month.
