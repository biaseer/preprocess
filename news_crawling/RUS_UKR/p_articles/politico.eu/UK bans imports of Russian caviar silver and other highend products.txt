Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the significant sanctions will bring the U.K.'s total import tariffs and bans on Russian goods to more than 1 billion, imposing further economic pain on Putins economy for his barbaric and unjustified attacks on a sovereign nation.
The U.K. government announced Thursday import bans on Russian silver, wood products and luxury goods. The latest measures will also see tariffs increase by 35 percentage points on around 130 million worth of Russian and Belarusian products, including diamonds and rubber.
Announcing the sanctions, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the U.K. continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine.
Earlier Thursday the U.K. targeted a range of Russian generals and defense companies involved in the war in Ukraine in its latest round of sanctions.
We are taking every opportunity we can to ratchet the pressure to isolate the Russian economy and these further measures will tighten the screws, shutting down lucrative avenues of funding for Putins war machine, she said.
LONDON  The U.K. has imposed an import ban on Russian caviar as part of a fresh tranche of sanctions against Vladimir Putins regime over the war in Ukraine.
The U.K. has already banned the import of iron and steel products from Russia and Belarus, alongside stopping luxury goods exports to Russia, among other measures.
