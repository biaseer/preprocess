Gazprom said in a statement this morning that it "has notified Bulgargaz and Polish utility PGNiG of the suspension of gas supplies from April 27" after they refused Kremlin demands to pay for gas in rubles, something they said violated the terms of their contracts.
Von der Leyen said EU countries had prepared contingency plans for a gas shutdown, and that a meeting of the bloc's gas coordination group of national authorities and energy agencies was taking place "right now."
Bulgarian Energy Minister Alexander Nikolov this morning denounced Gazprom for using natural gas as "a political and economic weapon" and said his country can meet the needs of its users for at least one month.
"We are mapping out our coordinated EU response. We will also continue working with international partners to secure alternative flows," she said.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen Wednesday denounced Russia for using gas "as an instrument of blackmail" after Gazprom halted  shipments of gas to Poland and Bulgaria.
"This is unjustified and unacceptable," she said in a statement. "And it shows once again the unreliability of Russia as a gas supplier."
The EU is preparing a sixth round of sanctions against Russia in retaliation for its attack on Ukraine, and is mulling sanctions against oil. Gas had been off the table due to opposition from many EU countries, led by Germany and Hungary, worried about the economic impact of such a step.
