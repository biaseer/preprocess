Kyiv has banned mass celebrations to mark Ukraines Independence Day on Wednesday, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned citizens to be alert to possible Russian strikes.
The ban comes after Zelenskyy warned that Moscow could try something particularly nasty in the run-up to Ukraines 31st Independence Day. The day will also mark six months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
We should be aware that this week Russia may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel, Zelenskyy said during an address over the weekend.
Russia has blamed Ukraine for the killing of Darya Dugina  the daughter of Alexander Dugin, a Russian ideologue and Vladimir Putin ally  with Russian nationalists calling for an escalation of strikes against their neighbor.
The move comes in order to ensure the safety of citizens, and events must provide for the possibility of sheltering participants in the case of air raid alerts.
The U.S. State Department said that Moscow is stepping up efforts to strike civilian infrastructure in the coming days, marking the first time the U.S. has specifically warned that civilian and government buildings could be targeted. The U.S. embassy advised American citizens to leave Ukraine on ground transportation if they can.
In Kharkiv, a northeastern city, the mayor announced the extension of an overnight curfew, from 4 p.m. to 7 a.m., effective from Tuesday to Thursday.
Fearing rocket attacks, the Kyiv city military administration introduced a ban on mass events Tuesday and Wednesday, it announced in a statement released Monday.
