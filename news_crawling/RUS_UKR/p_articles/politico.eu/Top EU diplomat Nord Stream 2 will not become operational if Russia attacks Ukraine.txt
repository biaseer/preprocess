Borrell's comments come as EU citizens struggle to pay energy bills, with governments implementing measures to soften the blow of soaring power prices.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today program about potential sanctions on Russia, Borrell said it was "quite reasonable and quite clear" that Nord Stream 2 "will not" be allowed to operate in the event of a Russian strike.
Western allies have struggled to present a united front on whether to target Nord Stream 2 in potential sanctions, following U.S. President Joe Biden's warning earlier this month that the pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany, will be stopped in case of a Russian strike on Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stressed unity with the U.S. but didn't mention the pipeline directly   while French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said that Europe should not be dragged into following the U.S. position on Nord Stream 2.
"It doesn't mean that Nord Stream 2 will stop working for ever. But if there is a war between Russia and Ukraine, certainly, I'm sorry to say that not only Nord Stream 2 will be affected, the whole supply of gas to Europe from Russia will be affected," Borrell said, adding that this would "certainly" have consequences for the price of gas in Europe.
Borrell added that sanctions would affect both sides: "Sanctions have also a cost. If you forbid exports, the economic sectors which are exporting will be badly affected, and certainly Russia will also retaliate."
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Tuesday that the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline will not become operational if Russia attacks Ukraine.
