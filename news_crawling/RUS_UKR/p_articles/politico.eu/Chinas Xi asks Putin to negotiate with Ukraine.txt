In a major diplomatic intervention, Chinese President Xi Jinping has asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate with Ukraine  with Beijing offering no clear endorsement of the ongoing war.
In further remarks that probably wont go down well in the Kremlin, Xi said: China supports Russia and Ukraine in resolving the issue through negotiation.
Chinese media also reported Putin as saying Russia is willing to begin high-level negotiations with Ukraine, though its unclear whether the Russian president attached any condition or specified when that might happen.
The situation in eastern Ukraine has undergone rapid changes, drawing great attention from the international community. Chinas position would be based on the right and wrong in relation to the Ukraine issue itself, Xi told Putin on Friday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.
China is consistent in the fundamental position on respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and abiding by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, Xi said.
While China sees Russia as a core partner, the Kremlins war puts China in a bind given Beijings difficulty in approving the violation of Ukraines sovereignty.
China is willing to work with all parties in the international community to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, he added.
Notably, Xis readout made no reference to previous attempts by China to blame NATO expansion or U.S. influence for problems in the region, though he said: It is necessary to abandon the Cold War mentality, attach importance to and respect the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and form a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism through negotiations.
