While work on the Strategic Compass started almost two years ago, officials have had to repeatedly rewrite the language as threats evolved. Russias invasion of Ukraine last month then gave a new sense of urgency to the document. Now, the bloc will start working on its implementation  no easy task given the EUs limited track record on military endeavors.
EU leaders on Friday endorsed a significantly revised and more muscular military strategy during a summit meeting, according to European Council President Charles Michel.
The so-called Strategic Compass represents a notable shift in the EUs collective military ambitions, which have historically been minuscule, with efforts channeled instead toward individual militaries and NATO capabilities. Still, the new plans ultimate ambitions are limited, envisioning among other things  the creation of an EU rapid deployment force of up to 5,000 soldiers but not the establishment of a full EU army.
France led the charge on updating the EUs military ambitions and prioritized the Strategic Compass during the countrys rotating EU presidency, which runs through June. EU foreign and defense ministers approved the new plans earlier this week.
When walking into the summit on Friday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stressed once again that the EUs defense plans are aimed at making the bloc astronger partner with both NATO and partners around the world, meaning the EU is not intending to duplicate NATO capabilities, a concern Baltic and Eastern European countries often express.
We endorsed the Strategic Compass which will be our guide for a stronger defence policy and bolster our European defence capabilities, Michel tweeted Friday morning.
