Early Monday, Michelle Mntefering, a member of the SPDs leadership, called for Schrders expulsion and said that the SPD should no longer accept his membership fee as it is dirty money.
Widespread fury about Schrders position was reignited at the weekend when the New York Times published an interview with the ex-chancellor in which he said he doesnt do mea culpa, while also dismissing the notion that Putin was behind the recent massacre of Ukrainians in Bucha, near Kyiv.
Honestly, in this phase of history, there is now only one side to take, the side of the Ukrainians, and its tragic that Gerhard Schrder has taken the other side, Lars Klingbeil, the other SPD co-leader, said Sunday.
Schrder, who served as German chancellor from 1998 to 2005, has been under pressure to resign from all the lucrative positions he holds with Russian energy companies and to publicly denounce Putin, but has so far failed to do either.
Gerhard Schrder has been acting merely as a businessman for many years, and we should stop perceiving him as an elder statesman and former chancellor, said Saskia Esken, one of the two co-leaders of the Social Democrats SPD, the party of current Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
BERLIN Senior German Social Democrats want former Chancellor Gerhard Schrder booted out of the party because of his refusal to denounce Russian President Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine.
Esken said in an interview on German radio Monday that she is in favor of Schrder leaving the party, adding that several motions are already underway to facilitate his departure. These proceedings are conducted according to the statutes of the SPD, but there are quite rightly high hurdles for an expulsion from the party, she said.
