Outgoing Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov on Tuesday announced the expulsion of 70 Russian diplomats  many of them spies using diplomatic cover  for interfering in the Balkan countrys domestic affairs.
The move is an unprecedentedly decisive step against the Kremlin in a country where ties to Moscow run deep.
On Sunday, we expect a full plane with 70 seats to head off back to Moscow, he told TV reporters in Sofia.
Petkov, who attempted to chart an unusually pro-NATO and transatlanticist course after the invasion of Ukraine, has complained that the Russians  along with Bulgarias own sometimes Moscow-linked mafia  helped topple him in a vote of no confidence last week.
