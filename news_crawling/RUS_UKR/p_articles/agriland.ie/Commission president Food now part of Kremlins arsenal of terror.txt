It is estimated that 20 million tonnes of grain is currently trapped in Ukraine. The country is among the worlds biggest grain exporters.
The EU Commission president noted that some of the global food insecurity issues and debt distress are a legacy of the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change.
Food has become part of the Kremlins arsenal of terror and we cannot tolerate this, the European Commission president has said.
This is a cold, callous and calculated siege by Putin on some of the most vulnerable countries and peoples in the world, Von der Leyen told the EU Parliament.
The World Bank has estimated 10 million people are pushed into extreme poverty for every percentage point increase in food prices.
It is our duty to dismantle Russias disinformation. Our sanctions do not touch basic food commodities. They do not affect the trading of grain or other food between Russia and third countries, she said.
In an address to the EU Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday Wednesday, June 8, Ursula Von der Leyen condemned Russias bombardment of grain storage facilities in Ukraine and its blockade of ports in the country.
Von der Leyen said that 275 million people across the world are likely to be at risk of food insecurity during 2022, according to Euro News Radio.
She also pointed to the wider cost-of-living crisis, including the rising price of energy which has driven up the cost of fertiliser and transport.
So lets stick to the truth, its Putins war of aggression that fuels the food crisis and nothing else, she told MEPs.
