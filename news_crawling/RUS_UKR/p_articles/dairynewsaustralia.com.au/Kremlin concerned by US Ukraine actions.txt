The Kremlin says Washington's actions and statements around Ukraine are escalating tensions and Russia is watching with great concern after the United States put 8500 troops on alert to be ready to deploy to Europe if needed.
NATO said on Monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, in what Russia denounced as Western "hysteria" in response to its build-up of troops on the Ukraine border.
