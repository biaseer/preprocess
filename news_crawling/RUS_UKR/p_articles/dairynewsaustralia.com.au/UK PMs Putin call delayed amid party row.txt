"He has been clear at all points that pursuing that path would be extremely costly for the Russian people and it's something we want to avoid and will continue to negotiate on."
But the No 10 spokesman said: "We, on our part, are seeking to reflect and shine a light on some of the approaches and tactics being used by Russia with the intention of encouraging them to step back from going any further."
"It's not unusual for timings with world leaders to change and you will appreciate the control of the timing for the receipt of this report rightly was with Sue Gray and her team, and the prime minister had committed to come to the House to make an update."
"Our aim is to continue to encourage Russia to take a diplomatic path, to de-escalate and to step back from what could be a very costly exercise if they were to follow the path of further aggression," the prime minister's spokesperson said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged other world leaders to tone down their rhetoric about the risk of war.
Downing Street said it is "looking to finalise the time" for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to hold a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin after reports suggested a call between the two leaders had been cancelled.
Downing Street had earlier said that Johnson would tell the Russian president on Monday to "take a diplomatic path" and avoid "very costly" military action in Ukraine.
The prime minister's official spokesperson said there had not been a "settled time" for the call, explaining that Sue Gray's much anticipated report into lockdown parties held at his Downing Street and Johnson's plan to make a statement on its findings to the House of Commons had made setting a time for the call challenging.
