He has managed to speak to some family and friends in Kyiv, many of whom have made the journey to stay with his parents, but has not been able to speak to others in Kharkiv, which is under heavy attack from Russian forces, StaffordshireLive reports.
He said: This is a horrendous situation for my home country and I still can't quite believe that it is happening. I was there in early January and nobody really thought that Ukraine would be invaded in this day and age - it is insane. I have been able to speak to most of my family, especially my parents, who live in the south-west, which is currently relatively calm.
"They have taken in many family and friends, including from Kyiv and the surrounding area, and they've prepared the basement as a place of safety.
"If I didn't have children here to support, I'd be joining the thousands of others who've returned to Ukraine to defend the country."
A Ukrainian dad-of-six says he would happily return home to fight Russia were it not for his children living in Staffordshire.

He came to the UK 20 years ago to study and returned here in 2005, where he married wife Tracy and settled down.
Oleksandr Burlaka - known as Alex - has not been able to reach some of his family in Ukraine as Russia's invasion continues.
Alex frequently returns home to visit family in Ukraine and his three youngest children - aged eight, 11 and 14 - have spent their summer holidays every year with their grandparents in the south-west of the now-war-torn nation.
