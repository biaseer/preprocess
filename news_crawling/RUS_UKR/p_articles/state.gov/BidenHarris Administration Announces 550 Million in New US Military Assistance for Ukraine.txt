Today, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the President, I am authorizing our seventeenth drawdown since August 2021 of up to $550 million in arms and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense DoD inventories for Ukraines self-defense. Todays announcement includes more ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems HIMARS and 155mm artillery systems that Ukraines forces are using so effectively on the battlefield to defend their country. This drawdown will bring total U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to approximately $8.7 billion since the beginning of this Administration.
Our commitment to the people of Ukraine will not waver. We stand united with Ukraine.
More than five months into Russias brutal and unprovoked assault the people of Ukraine inspire the world as they defend their country and their freedom. The United States continues to stand with Allies and partners from more than 50 countries in providing vital security assistance to support Ukraines defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russias aggression.
