The pope, meanwhile, said, "I'm not going to Kiev for now. I feel I shouldn't go. I have to go to Moscow first, I have to meet Putin first."
Pope Francis says Russias February-present military operation in Ukraine was likely Moscows reaction to the Western military alliance of NATOs eastward expansion ambitions.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation aimed at demilitarization of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine. In 2014, the two regions declared themselves new republics, refusing to recognize Ukraines Western-backed government.
Announcing the operation, Putin said the mission was aimed at defending people who for eight years are suffering persecution and genocide by the Kiev regime.
The Holy See said he had requested to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine around 20 days into the conflict, saying that "I was willing to go to Moscow."
Russia has signaled a willingness to end the operation if Ukraine accepted Moscows security demands, which include Kievs refusal to join NATO.
Moscow perhaps reacted to NATOs barking at Russias gate, the pontiff told Italys Corriere Della Sera newspaper that published the interview on Tuesday.
At the same time, however, he has expressed skepticism about Moscow's stated plan of a military scaleback, saying, "We will not decrease our defense efforts." Moscow has, on the other hand, complained repeatedly that Kiev keeps changing its position concerning the conflict.
