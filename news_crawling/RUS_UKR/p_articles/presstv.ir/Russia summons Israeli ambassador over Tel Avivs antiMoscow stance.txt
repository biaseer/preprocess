The summons came on Sunday after the Israeli regimes foreign minister Yair Lapid accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine.
It also called the Israeli regimes support for it a thinly veiled attempt to take advantage of the situation around Ukraine in order to divert the attention of the international community from one of the oldest unresolved conflicts  the Palestinian-Israeli one.
Russia has denied targeting civilians during the operation and has said it would halt the military operation instantly if Kiev met Moscows list of conditions. Moscow has specified some of the demands as protection of its interests and nationals in Ukraine and prevention of the ex-Soviet republics accession to the Western military alliance of NATO.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation aimed at demilitarization of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine. In 2014, the two regions declared themselves new republics, refusing to recognize Ukraines Western-backed government.
The Russian foreign ministry has summoned the Israeli ambassador to Moscow after Tel Aviv denouncedRussias military operation in Ukraine.
