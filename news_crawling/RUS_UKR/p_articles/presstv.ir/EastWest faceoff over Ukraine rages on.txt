A serious crisis with devastating consequences for the region and the world. We asked people in the streets of London what they made of it. Russia denies any plans to invade its neighbor but it has threatened action if it doesnt receive sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO.
As the crisis between Russia and Ukraine escalates, so does the East-West face-off. NATO-member UK announced its first round of sanctions on Russia this week. The punitive measures followed Russian recognition of the breakaway republics of Donesk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. That decision drew condemnation from European capitals and the US.
Experts say the crisis has not come out of nowhere. The West has had some 30 years to come to terms with Russia's demands almost 20 years of it under the same presidentbut it has failed utterly to engage.
NATO Chief Jans Stoltenberg called it a violation of international agreements. The former soviet republic of Ukraine is not a member of North Atlantic Military Alliance, yet its received considerable military and financial support from NATO member states despite Russian warnings they are turning the Eastern European country into a powder keg.
