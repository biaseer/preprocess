On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military campaign in Ukraine over concerns about destabilizing activities close to Russia's borders by NATO, an intergovernmental military alliance comprised of 28 European countries plus Canada and the US.
Members of the Assembly of Experts do not convene frequently. They hold such sessions twice a year to review the latest domestic and global issues. This time, they touched on the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, demanding an immediate end to the crisis.
The Assembly of Experts was established in 1983, almost four years after the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Irans Assembly of Experts has wrapped up its ninth open session andthe members of the Assembly called for an end to the Russo-Ukrainian crisis which has been ongoing for some two weeks now.
Its main task is to monitor the performance of the Leader of Irans Islamic Revolution. The experts should also elect a new leader in the event of the demise, resignation or dismissal of the current leader.
The Assembly of Experts is currently a body of 88 Islamic jurists. The entity consists of a leadership council and six committees. Members are elected by direct public vote for an eight-year term.
Although the Islamic Republic is on the same page with Russia over NATOs provocative activities in the region, it has repeatedly stated that war is not a solution to the crisis. The Assembly of Experts echoes the same stance.
