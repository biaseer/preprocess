As concerns over possible escalation continue to increase, Finland and Sweden are expected to announce, before the end of this month, if they intend to join NATO.
On Tuesday, the European Commission defended the decisions taken by EU governments to send arms to Ukraine.
A quarter of those questioned said the West's supply of weapons to fighters in Ukraine is "a bad thing."
There are many security experts who claim the expansion of NATO in recent years close to Russia's borders, and provocative military exercises, are factors that brought about the conflict in Ukraine. Now EU members, Finland and Sweden are poised to announce they want to join NATO.
Finland shares a border with Russia that is more than 1300-kilometres long. Moscow points out that if this country was to join the 30-nation alliance, NATO's land border with the Russian Federation wouldmore than double in length.
A new opinion poll by Le Soir newspaper has found that 90 of citizens surveyed in Belgium said the war worries them but that they do not support direct military intervention over concerns that it could trigger a new world war.
