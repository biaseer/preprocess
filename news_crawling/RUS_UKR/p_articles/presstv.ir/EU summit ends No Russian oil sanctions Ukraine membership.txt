The Western members of the EU led the swift rejection of Ukraines appeal for fast-track membership to the bloc.
A poll last month showed that two-thirds of France is favorable to organizing a referendum on leaving the European Union. If massive and controversial changes arent approved with a democratic vote, its possible the EU could be fomenting even more discontent.
The EU and NATO claim they have excluded direct military intervention in Ukraine. The EU did double to 1 billion euros the amount of military aid for Ukraine. Its the first such military involvement for the bloc, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012.
A two-day summit of European Union leaders in Versailles, France to discuss Russias military operation in Ukraine concluded with increasingly belligerent rhetoric possibly overshadowing the rejection of concrete sanctions.
Led by the Eastern members of the bloc, the EU will not impose sanctions on Russian gas and oil. In mid-May a proposal could be unveiled to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027.
Some in Europe are saying that Russias military action is on the same level as 911, and that the EU must bolster cooperation on defense and drastically boost military spending.
After the United States admitted the presence of facilities, the United Nations Security Council will hold an urgent meeting to discuss biological weapons labs in Ukraine.
If the EU follows through on some of these promises and sanctions, Europe will likely see a multi-year effect on prices of food, energy and basic goods the green transition which some think is so vital will likely need to be reversed. The summit ends much as it began: its not fully clear how far the EU will go to get involved in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
