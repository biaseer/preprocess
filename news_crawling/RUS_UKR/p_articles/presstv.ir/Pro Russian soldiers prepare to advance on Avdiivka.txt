While Ukraine is putting up a fierce defense in Donbas, the advantage is Russias, with its overwhelming artillery superiority. As this conflict approaches its sixth month, soldiers are dying for each kilometer of land.
We reach the trenches. Opposing them is the Ukrainian stronghold of Avdiivka. For eight years the Ukrainians have been digging in, creating a complex network of underground bunkers. It will be one of the greatest challenges for Russia in this war so far.
Suddenly, we are told to run as we reach open ground. The pro-Russians had just fired a heavy artillery barrage. The Ukrainians will most likely respond in kind.
Im heading with pro Russian forces to the frontline just outside the city of Donetsk. We move at a fast pace, as there is constant incoming and outgoing at these positions.
While NATO and Ukraine have been declaring for months that morale is low this side of the battle lines, all the pro Russian fighters Ive spoken to over two months hereclearly have high moral. They are in no doubt they will take Avdiivka soon, as well as the rest of Donbas. And they believe they are fighting for a worthy cause.
