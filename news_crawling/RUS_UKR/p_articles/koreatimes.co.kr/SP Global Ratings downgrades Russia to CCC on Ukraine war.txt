"This has rendered a large part of these reserves inaccessible, undermining the CBR's ability to act as a lender of last resort and impairing what had been  until recently  Russia's standout credit strength: its net external liquidity position," the agency said.
The United States and European Union have responded with fury to the invasion of Ukraine, sanctioning Russia's central bank and banning some of its financial institutions from the SWIFT messaging network.
SP Global Ratings downgraded Russia's debt rating to "CCC-," Thursday, citing Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine that the agency said increased the risk of a default.
