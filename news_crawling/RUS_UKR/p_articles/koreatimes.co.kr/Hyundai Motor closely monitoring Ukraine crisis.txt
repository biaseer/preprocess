Kia, a sister brand of Hyundai Motor, also operates manufacturing lines there. In 2021, Kia sold 205,000 cars in Russia, and Hyundai sold 186,000, to become the second- and third-largest car brands there following local Russian brand Avtovaz.
The analysts said Hyundai Motor may have difficulties exporting cars to Russia or suffer foreign exchange losses as Western countries impose economic sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine.
"I think that Hyundai is closely watching the ongoing situation. The exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system will have little impact on its business there," the official said.
An industry official familiar with the matter said the company will likely have no big problems in Russia as it produces and sells locally there.
Hyundai Motor shares fell sharply to 173,000 won from 180,500 won last Thursday when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, the shares inched up by 1,000 won or 0.57 percent to 175,000 won from last Friday, while the benchmark KOSPI rose 0.84 percent to 2,699.18.
Hyundai Motor has been monitoring the escalating Russia-Ukraine military conflict closely, as it has and will adversely affect Korea's largest carmaker, which has been operating a plant in Russia, according to securities analysts Monday.
Due to the sanction, Im Eun-young, an analyst at Samsung Securities, presumed that Hyundai Motor could suffer up to 200 billion won $166 million in losses and Kia could see up to 250 billion won in losses.
