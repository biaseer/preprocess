Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told USSecretary of State Antony Blinken that China opposes any moves that "add fuel to the flames" in Ukraine.
Blinken says the world is watching to see which nations stand up for the principles of freedom and sovereignty.
The USState Department says Blinken underscored that the world is acting in unison in response to Russian aggression and ensuring that Moscow will pay a high price.
Wang called for negotiations to resolve the immediate crisis, as well as talks on creating a balanced European security mechanism. Wang says the USand Europe should pay attention to the negative impact of NATO's eastward expansion on Russia's security.
China has broken with the US, Europe and others that have imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. China says that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations should be respected, but that sanctions create new issues and disrupt the process of political settlement.
