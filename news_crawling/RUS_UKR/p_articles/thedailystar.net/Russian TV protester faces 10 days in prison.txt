A Russian journalist who protested Moscow's military action in Ukraine during a prime-time news broadcast on state TV was in court yesterday, facing 10 days in jail for the demonstration. Marina Ovsyannikova, a state television employee who barged onto the set of Russia's most-watched evening news broadcast holding a poster, went on trial for breaching protest laws, a Moscow court representative told AFP. She pleaded not guilty. The poster, clearly visible for a few seconds, read: "No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here." Ukraine's President Zelensky also praised her for "telling the truth". But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called her actions an act of hooliganism.
