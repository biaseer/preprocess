Dozens of countries from around the world called on Russia Wednesday to halt the war in Ukraine.
In a statement these 40-odd countries said they support Ukraine's proceedings before the International Court of Justice seeking "to establish that Russia has no lawful basis to take military action in Ukraine on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations of genocide."
This alludes to Russia's stated justification early in the war that it invaded to halt what it called genocide in pro-Russian areas of eastern Ukraine.
