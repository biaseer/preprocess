Meanwhile, the price of autogas or LPG for motor vehicles has increased from Tk 57.81 to Tk 64.78 a litre.
The price of LPG cylinders of other sizes will also go up at the same rate, said Abdul Jalil, chairman of Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission BERC, at a virtual press briefing yesterday.
The Saudi CP is the international price benchmark set at the beginning of each month by Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company Aramco.
The LPG price started decreasing in December after increasing in the previous five months. In January, the price went down by 4 percent. But in February it rose by 5 percent.
BERC chairman Jalil said the Russia-Ukraine war pushed up the LPG price globally, creating a crisis in the energy market.
"We are forced to hike the local LPG price as the Saudi contract price CP has risen globally -- from $775 per tonne to $911. Earlier, local firms faced supply disruptions. But now the problem has been resolved."
The price of 12kg liquefied petroleum gas supplied by firms in cylinders has increased to Tk 1,391, up Tk 151 from its February price.
The BERC chairman, however, said prices of the state-owned LP Gas Company's LPG will remain unchanged as it's not linked to the global market rates.
The BERC, for the first time, fixed the retail-level LPG price on April 12 last year after holding a public hearing.
