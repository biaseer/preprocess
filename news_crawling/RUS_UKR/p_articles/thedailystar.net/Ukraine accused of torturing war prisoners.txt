Last week Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 144 prisoners of war each -- the biggest exchange since the start of Moscow's Ukraine campaign launched on February 24.
Russia yesterday said it was investigating the torture of Russian soldiers held prisoner in Ukraine and recently released as part of a prisoner swap with Kyiv in late June.
The Russian Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said in a statement that it was "verifying facts of inhuman treatment of Russia soldier prisoners in Ukraine".
