Facebook has hit out at the ban on its platforms by Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Russia's media regulator said in a statement: "Since October 2020, 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook have been recorded."
In response Meta said: "We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organize for action."
Facebook's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, in response said that "soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information," reports BBC.
