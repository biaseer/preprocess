Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk today said he was challenging Russian President Vladimir Putin to a single combat over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reports Business Insider.
The SpaceX boss, however, did not go into any further detail regarding how this will actually take place, reports Business Insider.
"Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom," SpaceX's launch director said in response as the company launched Starlink satellites on Wednesday.
In a follow-up post later, Musk tagged the Russian presidency's official Twitter account and asked, "Do you consent to this fight?"
"I hereby issue a single combat challenge to Vladimir Putin. Ukraine is on the line," Musk said in a bizarre tweet on Monday, writing Putin's name using Russian alphabets.
In reaction to US sanctions, Dmitry Rogozin, the president of Russia's space agency Roscosmos, warned earlier this month that Russia would no longer deliver rocket engines to the US, reports Business Insider.
