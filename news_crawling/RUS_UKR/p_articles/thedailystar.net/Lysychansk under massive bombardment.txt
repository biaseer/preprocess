On the Russian side, authorities in the Ukraine-bordering Rostov region said yesterday that a fire at an oil refinery might have been caused by a Ukrainian drone strike.
Moscow's troops have been pummelling eastern Ukraine for weeks and are slowly advancing, despite fierce resistance from the outgunned Ukrainian military.
"The Russian army is massively shelling Lysychansk," Sergiy Gaiday, governor of the Lugansk region, which includes both cities, wrote on Telegram.
He later wrote that "it's just hell out there" after four months of shelling in Severodonetsk, across the Donets river -- while adding that "our boys are holding their positions and will continue to hold on as long as necessary".
"Massive" Russian bombardment of the strategic eastern city of Lysychansk and key city Severodonetsk has been "hell" for soldiers there, Kyiv said, while insisting that defenders would hold "as long as necessary".
Russian forces have been occupying villages in the area, and taking control of the two cities would give Moscow control of the whole of Lugansk, allowing them to press further into the Donbas, reports AFP.
With President Vladimir Putin's forces tightening their grip on the strategically important city of Severodonetsk in the Donbas, its twin city of Lysychansk is now coming under heavier bombardment.
