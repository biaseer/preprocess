"Within the next couple days, we're obviously going to continue talking with our European partners, we're going to continue talking with our Russian partners and finding a way forward," a senior administration official told reporters.
And the White House said Biden "reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
But the White House stressed that Biden, in his calls on Thursday, was also pushing for reinvigorated diplomacy, including the stalled peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.
Biden also placed a separate call to the leaders of Nato members Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, which are all in eastern Europe and deeply concerned by Russian military threats to Ukraine.
They "discussed Russia's destabilizing military buildup along Ukraine's border and the need for a united, ready, and resolute Nato stance for the collective defense of allies," the White House said.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement thanking Biden for his "strong support" in a phone call lasting about an hour and a half.
Biden had already spent two hours talking to President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, warning him that if Russian troops now massed next to Ukraine launch a major attack, Moscow would then face US economic sanctions "like none he's ever seen."
President Joe Biden gave "strong" backing Thursday to Ukraine in its struggle with Russia and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict in eastern Europe, while promising US help if Moscow attacks.
