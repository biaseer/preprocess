Tnaiste Leo Varadkar has compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier in the week.
"We've known that for a long time now but we didn't think that he would be the Hitler of the 21st century."
Speaking on Friday evening on RT's Drivetime, The Tnaiste said what is taking place in Ukraine currently is an "atrocity" and that he believes it resembles "what happened to Czechoslovakia in 1939".
"The kind of things that might force them to the table and therefore, potentially, enable a solution or a political solution down the line."
"For example, seizing the personal assets of Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and members of the Russian Security Council... doing things that will damage their economy, damage the support within Russia and among the Russian elite for the current Government in Russia.
Varadkar also said that the Irish Government "fully supports Ukraine" and its right to democracy and to join the European Union or NATO if it wishes to do so.
"We want wider sanctions against Russia than has been agreed already by the European Union.
Following Varadkar's comments, it has been reported that EU states have agreed to freeze any European assets of Putin and Lavrov.
