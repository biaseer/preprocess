"I am a Russian warship," a voice says. "I ask you to lay down your arms and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary deaths. Otherwise, you will be bombed."
While the Russian warship insisted the soldiers would "be bombed" should they refuse surrender, the Facebook post suggests they were taken as prisoners from Snake Island to Sevastopol, a Crimean port city.
Russian Major-General Igor Konashenkov said that soldiers "laid down their arms and voluntarily surrendered to a unit of the Russian Armed Forces."
Chilling audio from the initial confrontation went viral, with many people commending the soldiers for their word choice and resilience in the face of danger.
The Thirteen Ukraine border guards who were presumed dead after they told a Russian warship to "go fk yourself" may actually be alive.
But on Friday, Russia's Ministry of Defence said that 82 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered to them voluntarily. They did not mention anything regarding violence or the previously reported air assault.
In response, two Ukrainian border guards can be heard conversing with one another as the severity of the situation sets in.
The post also adds that border guards were attacked by Russian aircraft and an assault from ship-based weapons. Following the onslaught, officials lost contact with those posted on the island.
Soldiers on Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, were thought to be dead following their standoff with a Russian warship on Friday 25 February. The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine updated people via Facebook, stating that the soldiers may be alive.
