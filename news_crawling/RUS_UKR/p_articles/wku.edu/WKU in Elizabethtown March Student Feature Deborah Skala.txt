My vision for the future is to end generational poverty and homelessness in Hardin County by 2033, said Deborah.
Deborah eventually enrolled in the Social Work program at WKU in Elizabethtown and says that she wants to use her case management skills to help adults get out and stay out of poverty.
Originally from Cincinnati, Deborah and her husband have two children. She enjoys languages, reading, leading small group Bible Studies. She also enjoys traveling, which has taken her to Spain, Russia, Ukraine, Hawaii, and Germany.
After being a licensed physical therapy assistant for over 30 years, Deborah Skala felt a different calling. She felt especially interested in issues of poverty and homelessness and became a certified trainer in Bridges Out of Poverty, an initiative to help organizations address poverty within their community.
Deborah plans to lead a full productive life with my family, working in the community with people of all socio-economic levels and backgrounds, helping them all live well together.
