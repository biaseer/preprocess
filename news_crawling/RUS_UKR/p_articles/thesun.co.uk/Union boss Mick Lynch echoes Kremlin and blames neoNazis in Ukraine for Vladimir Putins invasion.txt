Yesterdays 24-hour walk-out by 6,500 Aslef members affected nine operators  wiping out services for five of them.
Mr Lynch told the New Statesman: The EU also provoked a lot of the trouble in Ukraine. It was all about being pro-EU and all the rest of it.
His comments came ahead of the latest disruption on the railways yesterday when train drivers from Aslef went on strike.
Earlier this year, Mr Lynch condemned the Russian invasion and called for their troops to withdraw from Ukraine.
Members of the RMT and TSSA unions will strike on Thursday and Saturday, while Londons Tube and buses will be hit by action on Friday.
And while they were doing that, there were an awful lot of people playing with Nazi imagery and going back to the Second World war and all that.
London Euston and Birmingham New Street stations were closed and disruption was likely to spill over into today.
But his latest remarks mirror the Kremlins claim that it invaded to denazify the country.
The leader of the RMT, whose strikes have crippled train travel, also claims the EU was partly to blame for Vladimir Putins war.
RAIL union boss Mick Lynch says neo-Nazis in Ukraine helped to stir up Russias invasion.
