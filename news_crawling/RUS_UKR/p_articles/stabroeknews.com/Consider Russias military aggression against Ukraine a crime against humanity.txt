As most people and nations are clearly aware, the Russian attack on Ukraine is the greatest crisis since the Second World War and all must meet it with skill and a commitment to resist the threat. Now that Russia has launched its genocidal attack, all needs to do three things. First, we must recognize, publicly and internationally, that every Ukrainian killed, whether fighting to defend Ukraine or as a passive citizen, is a victim of murder. Russia must be identified as a terrorist state supporting mass murder. As citizens of this world we can confirm that the provisions of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act, which was enacted in 2000, apply to the actions of the Russian Head of State and to the Russian and Belarusian states and armies. Calling it a war suggests a kind of equivalency between two parties. It is not a war. It is a state-sponsored attack and must be identified as such. It is a crime against humanity. All nations must publicly and repeatedly state their intention to launch proceedings before the World Court to identify Russia and all its state actors, including military personnel as well as Belarus, as international war criminals. This will allow for the seizure of substantial Russian assets in the West to pay as reparations to Ukraine, if and when Ukraine is ever in a position to rejoin the international community, as a free nation.
