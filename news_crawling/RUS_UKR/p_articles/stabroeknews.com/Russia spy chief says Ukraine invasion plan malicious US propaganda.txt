Naryshkin spoke a day after the State Departments top U.S. diplomat for European affairs said all options were on the table in how to respond to Russias troop buildup near Ukraines border and that NATO would decide on the next move after consultations next week.
U.S., NATO and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements near the border with Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch an attack.
MOSCOW, Reuters  Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine and suggestions to the contrary are malicious U.S. propaganda, Moscows foreign intelligence chief said yesterday.
Everything that is happening around this topic right now is of course malicious propaganda by the U.S. State Department.
While U.S. officials have voiced concerns about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine, Moscow has accused Washing-ton, Kyiv and NATO of provocative and irresponsible behaviour near its borders.
Russia has repeatedly said it is free to move its troops on its own territory and that such movements should not be a cause for concern.
I need to reassure everyone. Nothing like this is going to happen, Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russias foreign intelligence agency, said in an interview broadcast on state television, referring to comments on Russias alleged invasion plans.
