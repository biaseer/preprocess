The Economist is looking for a writer to join its team of China correspondents. You should be able to read and speak Chinese as well as write excellent, lively English. You should also have a good understanding of Chinese politics and society, and a proven ability as an analyst. Experience as a foreign correspondent in China would be an asset, as would willingness to be stationed in Beijing. We would also consider outstanding applicants who can make a case for covering mainland China from another location. All applicants should be prepared to cover mainland affairs from Hong Kong or another appropriate location while waiting for a Chinese visa.
Please send a CV and an unpublished 600-word article, suitable for use in the China section of The Economist, to emailprotected. The deadline is November 30th. Examples of stories in the China section can be found here.
