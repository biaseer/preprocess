And with the fighting raging, people have been unable to leave hospital, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Ukrainian military in the Donetsk region.
Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said hundreds of civilians managed to leave Mariupol in cars for the second successive day, but the aid convoy trying to reach the port city was stuck at nearby Berdyansk as Russian shelling continued.
