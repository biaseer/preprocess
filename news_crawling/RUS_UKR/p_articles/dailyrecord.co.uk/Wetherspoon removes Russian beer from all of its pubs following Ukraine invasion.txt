In a statement, the price comparison website said that it wanted to be sensitive in its use of advertising during the crisis.
A spokesperson for the pub firm said: In light of the situation in Ukraine we just gelt that we could not stock it anymore.
As of today all those beers wont be available in any Wetherspoons pub and either have been or are in the process of being returned to the Carlsberg distributor.
We are not implying in any way that anyone involved with the brewery is directly involved with whats going on but we thought in light of the current situation our pubs dont want to be serving Russian beers.
Compare the Market said earlier this week that it would not run adverts featuring Russian-accented mascot Aleksandr Orlov during news programmes amid the conflict.
The Glasgow Film Festival, which is due to begin this week, also announced that two Russian films would be removed from its programme.
The pub chain confirmed that it will no longer stock Baltika Lager, which is brewed in Russian President Vladimir Putins homeland of St Petersburg.
In a statement issued to the Mirror, Wetherspoon said that it was not implying that the brewer was involved in the invasion in any way.
