The eccentric business magnate replied hours later to say the Starlink service was online in Ukraine and more of its dishes are "en route".
Following a request for help from the country's deputy prime minister, Mr Musk said his satellite-internet service Starlink was "now active" in Ukraine.
SpaceX has been developing the space-based system, which uses around 2,000 satellites to bring internet access to underserved areas of the world, with the company referring to its dishes as terminals.
His younger brother Kimbal shared the "now active" post with the caption: "Go team Ukraine! Putin has to be stopped. It's either now or later. I say now. Are you with me?"
He also gave a "special thanks" to Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, "for swift decisions related to authorisation and certification that allowed us to activate Starlink in Ukraine".
