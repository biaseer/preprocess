I share the statement of Dana Drbov, chair of the Czech State Office for Nuclear Safety, who immediately questioned the claims. It seemed impossible to her. The doses in the area are insufficient for radiation sickness.
Yes, although I feel that the whole reaction was too disproportional. It's a place where it's better not to do anything stupid. It's best when no one is there. Pripyat is a place tourists visit, but I wouldn't go there. I'm conservative in these regards.
Yet there is a but. We don't have much information. We heard trenches were supposedly found in the Red Forest. There are both dangerous and not dangerous places in the zone.
You should avoid radiation if you can. At work we observe every safety regulation. We don't work with radioactive material without reason. If there isn't any, why do it? The best and only safe dose is the one you're not exposed to.
After the forces pulled back Ukrainians said that there were trenches and that some Russian soldiers were suffering from radiation sickness. What do you think about this?
Slovak nuclear plants rely on fuel from Russia. Slovakia now has enough of it to last for at least a year. What then? We have other options, says nuclear physicist MARTIN VENHART. However, it's not easy to change a fuel supplier. Talking to the Sme daily, the physicist discusses the current situation in the Ukrainian nuclear plants, the threat of nuclear weapons, and even why he wouldn't go to Chernobyl.
