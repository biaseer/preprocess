Speaking further, the spokesman denied suggestions that Russian troops were responsible for killings in the town of Bucha and said were living in days of fakes and lies, adding that images of civilians murdered in the town were staged.
The killings drew international outrage, with Western leaders calling for war crimes investigations against Russia.
The resolution received a two-thirds majority in the 193-member assembly, with 93 nations voting in favour and 24 against, while 58 countries abstained from the process.
And we do hope that in coming days, in the foreseeable future, this operation will reach its goals or will finish it by the negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegation, he added.
Last weekend, viral videos from Bucha, a suburb of the capital, Kyiv, showed the streets littered with corpses, with some having their hands tied behind their backs.
His admission is significant because Russias ministry of defence had reportedly said 1,351 of its soldiers had been killed in the war while Ukraine had stated the number of Russian casualties as almost 19,000.
Dmitry Peskov, Russias presidential spokesman, said this on Thursday in an interview with Sky News.
Weve had significant losses of troops and its a huge tragedy for us, he said.
Peskov said the Russian military is doing its best to bring an end to war.
Subsequently on Thursday, the United Nations UN general assembly, adopted a resolution calling for the suspension of Russia from the human rights council.
