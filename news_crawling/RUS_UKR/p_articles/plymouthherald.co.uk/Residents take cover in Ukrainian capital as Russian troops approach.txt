Mr Zelensky reiterated his openness to talks with Russia in a video message on Saturday, saying he welcomed an offer from the leaders of Turkey and Azerbaijan to organise fresh diplomatic efforts.
Russian president Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine after he spent weeks denying this was his intention, all the while building up a force of almost 200,000 soldiers along the countries borders.
The US military has announced 350 million dollars 261 million in assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armour and small arms.
Among the possibilities that remain to block the Kremlins access to hundreds of billions in cash are sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, and cutting Russia from the Swift international payment system.
Footage showed soldiers inspecting burned-out vehicles after Ukraines 101st brigade reported destroying a column of two light vehicles, two trucks and a tank. The claim could not be verified.
Fighting also raged in two territories in eastern Ukraine that are controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Authorities in the city of Donetsk said hot water supplies to the city of about 900,000 were suspended because of damage to the system by Ukrainian shelling.
The Russian assault on Kyiv has led to a curfew being announced in the city, set to last through until Monday morning.
In addition to Kyiv, the Russian assault appeared to focus on Ukraines coastline, which stretches from near the Black Sea port of Odesa in the west to beyond the Azov Sea port of Mariupol in the east.
Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russias security council, warned that Moscow could react to the sanctions by opting out of the last remaining nuclear arms pact, freezing Western assets and cutting diplomatic ties with nations in the West.
Ukraines health minister reported that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others had been wounded during Europes largest land conflict since the Second World War.
However, a senior Russian official shrugged off sanctions as a reflection of Western political impotence.
Our weapon is our truth, and our truth is that its our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.
Highways into Kyiv from the east were dotted with checkpoints manned by uniformed Ukrainian troops and young men in civilian clothes carrying automatic rifles. Low-flying planes patrolled the skies, though it is unclear if they were Russian or Ukrainian.
Fighting on the citys outskirts suggested that small Russian units are trying to clear a path for the main forces.
That came a day after Mr Zelensky offered to negotiate a key Russian demand: that Ukraine should abandon ambitions of joining Nato.
Mr Putin has has not disclosed his ultimate plans for Ukraine, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraines government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscows Cold War-era influence.
Officials in Kyiv have urged residents to seek shelter, to stay away from windows and to take precautions to avoid flying debris or bullets.
Germany likewise said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the country, in a significant shift.
Instead, the US, the European Union and other countries have slapped wide-ranging sanctions on Russia, freezing the assets of Russian businesses and individuals including Mr Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.
