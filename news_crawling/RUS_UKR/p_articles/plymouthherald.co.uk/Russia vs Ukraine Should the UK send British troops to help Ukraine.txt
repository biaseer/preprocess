As tensions between Russia and Ukraine rise, we ask Plymouth Live readers for their say on the situation as it unfolds.
In the early hours of the morning, a major military attack on Ukraine was launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite months of denying planning such an attack.
The president of Ukraine has since imposed martial law after Russia launched an invasion of the country. It came into force as of 5.30am on Thursday and will be in place for a period of 30 days initially.
Switching from Ukraine to Russia, Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky made an emotional appeal to Russians to reject an attack, saying they were being lied to about Ukraine and if they Russia attack, if they try to take our county - our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children - we will be defending ourselves."
Western leaders have ruled out direct involvement but Johnson told the people of the Ukraine that the UK would stand with them in a crisis that could go on for many months.
The PM wants to diminish this dependence entirely and collectively cease dependence on Russian oil and gas he said in this speech today.
Putin aims to demilitarise Ukraine and prevent any further integration with European institutions. It is Putins claim that a NATO alliance in Ukraine would pose a threat to Russia.
There are other ways of aiding the European ally and they have been training Ukrainian forces for years.
The Prime Minister has declared that Russia has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction in a statement on Twitter.
In a televised speech at midday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK cannot and will not look away as Putin has unleashed war on our European continent, sending explosions and missile strikes into several parts of Ukraine including cities Kyiv and Kharkiv.
RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the increase in the cost of oil will inevitably lead to wholesale fuel prices going up, which will in turn push record pump prices even higher.
Over the last 7 years, Ukraine has moved towards European institutions, namely the EU and defence alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organisation NATO, after Russia seized part of Ukraines territory when its pro-Russian president was overthrown in early 2014.
Russia's aggression towards Ukraine has caused the price of oil close to $100 per barrel, but the UK is not as dependent as other European countries on Russian gas.

Ukraine has deep social and cultural ties with Russia, as a former Soviet republic and Russian is a common language there, but Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to fight for the country's freedom saying: "We're strong. We're ready for anything."
Russias invasion on Ukraine is set to heighten the current cost of living crisis in the UK, with British citizens being warned of soaring fuel prices, up to a grim milestone of 1.50 a litre and rising food bills.
