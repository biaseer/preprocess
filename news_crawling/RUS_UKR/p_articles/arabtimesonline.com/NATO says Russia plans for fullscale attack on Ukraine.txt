BRUSSELS, Feb 22: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Tuesday warned that Russia continues its military buildup around Ukraine to invade the country, noting that thousands more Alliance troops are deployed to the eastern part of it. Every indication is that Russia continues to plan for full-scale attack on Ukraine. We see the ongoing military build-up. They promised to step back but they continue to step up, he told reporters after and extraordinary meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission at NATO headquarters in Brussels. In the last weeks, Allies have deployed thousands of more troops to eastern part of the Alliance. And placed more on standby. We have over 100 jets at high alert. And there are more than 120 Allied ships at the sea, from the High North to the Mediterranean, he pointed out.
Stoltenberg said NATO and the rest of the international community warned there would be a high cost if Russia carried out further aggressive actions against Ukraine. He welcomed economic sanctions announced today by many NATO member states and the German Governments decision to not certify the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. We urge Russia, in the strongest possible terms, to choose the path of diplomacy. This is the most dangerous moment in European security for a generation, he added.KUNA
