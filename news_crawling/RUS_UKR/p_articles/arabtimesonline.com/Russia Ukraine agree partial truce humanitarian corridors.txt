MOSCOW, March 3: Russian and Ukrainian negotiators have reportedly reached an agreement on a partial temporary ceasefire and opening humanitarian corridors. During the second round of talks, hosted by Belarus, both sides agreed to set up liaison groups to organize the humanitarian corridors, Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky told the state-run TV channel on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Ukraines presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcomes of the second round of the talk fell short of Kyiv expectations. Both sides agreed to convene a third round soon, Tass news agency quoted him as saying. Unfortunately, Ukraine has not got the results it needs. There are decisions only on the organization of humanitarian corridors, he wrote in a tweet. KUNA
The ceasefire will be limited to the areas around the planned humanitarian corridors, said Medinsky, who is also Russias chief negotiator. Hailing todays deal as a substantial progress, the senior Russian official called on the Ukrainian civilians, trapped in the conflict, to take advantage of the corridors and flee the battlefield as soon as possible.
