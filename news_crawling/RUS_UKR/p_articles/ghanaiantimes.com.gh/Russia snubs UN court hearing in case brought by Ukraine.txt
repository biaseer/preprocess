Russia has boycotted hearings at the UNs highest court during which Ukraine was seeking an emergency order to halt hostilities, arguing that Moscow had falsely applied genocide law in justifying itsinvasion.Hearings began at the International Court of Justice ICJ in The Hague, the Netherlands, on Monday without legal representation for Russia.The fact that Russias seats are empty speaks loudly. They are not here in this court of law: They are on a battlefield waging an aggressive war against my country, Ukrainian envoy, Anton Korynevych, said.He urged Russia to lay down your arms and put forward your evidence.The court said it regretted Russias non-attendance. A hearing, initially set for Tuesday, for Russia to present its case was expected to be cancelled. In earlier cases before the ICJ, where a party did not show up to present its side, the court ruled without input from such parties.Countries have usually, but not always, followed the courts orders which are legally binding. A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in the Netherlands did not reply to a request for comment.Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has said Russias special military action wasnecessaryto protect people who had been subjected to bullying and genocide  meaning those whose first or only language was Russian  in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine said on Monday that Russias claim was baseless and the alleged genocide in eastern Ukraine was non-existent.The case centres on the interpretation of a 1948 treaty on the prevention of genocide signed by both countries. The treaty names the ICJ as the forum for resolving disputes between signatories.Ukraine said on Monday that Moscow was violating and abusing the genocide convention by using it as a justification for war.Russia must be stopped and the court has a role to play in stopping it, Korynevych told the judges as he asked for them to impose emergency measures.Ukraine comes to this court because of a grotesque lie and to seek protection from the devastating consequences of that lie, David Zionts, a lawyer for Ukraine, told the court.The lie is the Russian Federations claim of genocide in Ukraine. The consequences are unprovoked aggression, cities under siege, civilians under fire, humanitarian catastrophe and refugees fleeing for their lives.Al Jazeeras Charlie Angela, reporting from London, said Russias absence on Monday could be because one of their lawyers, Alain Pellet of France, resigned earlier in the week.In anopen letter, he said, Enough is enough. Its become impossible for me to represent a country that so cynically despises the law, Angela said, citing the letter. That has been a blow to their side.
