At the start of his address in the Polish capitals Royal Castle, he echoed the words of late pope John Paul II telling Ukrainians: Be not afraid.
Addressing ordinary Russians, he said that they were not our enemy and urged them to blame Putin for the heavy economic sanctions imposed by the West.
He also warned Russia not to move on an inch of NATO territory, reiterating the sacred obligation of collective defence for alliance members.
US President Joe Biden said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power and called the conflict in Ukraine a strategic failure for Moscow in a major speech in Warsaw.
Biden compared Ukraines resistance against a Russian invasion to the anti-Soviet battle for freedom and said the world must prepare for a long fight ahead.
At the conclusion of his sweeping address, he said: We will have a different future, a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light.
