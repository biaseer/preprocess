The White House later scrambled to deny he was seeking regime change in Moscow, while the Kremlin said Bidens words could harm bilateral relations.
French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday warned against verbal escalation with Moscow, after US President Joe Biden called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a butcher over his invasion of Ukraine.
Paris has kept diplomatic channels to Moscow open throughout Russias military buildup on Ukraines borders and invasion of its neighbour.
Bidens Saturday remarks were far more muscular, with the US chief executive using a visit to Poland to dub Putin a butcher who cannot remain in power.
Were looking with the Ukrainian authorities in the city of Mariupol at how to organise the evacuation of everyone who wants to flee.
There is a lot of cynicism from the Russian side on this question, Macron said.
He added that we have to do it quickly, in the very next days given the intensity of combat and bombardments in the city.
Macron told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of Russian troops by diplomatic means.
He nevertheless accused Putin Sunday of wanting to return to a Europe of empires, of domination, without respect for the integrity of borders and nations right to decide for themselves.
The stance has been criticised by some other leaders and commentators but defended by Macron as vital to limiting damage from the war.
Macron said that he would call Putin on Monday or Tuesday to discuss a proposal from France, Greece and Turkey to evacuate Ukrainians from besieged port city Mariupol.
