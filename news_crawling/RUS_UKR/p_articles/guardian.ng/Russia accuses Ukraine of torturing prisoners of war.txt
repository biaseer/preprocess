Russia said on Tuesday it was investigating the torture of Russian soldiers held prisoner in Ukraine and recently released as part of a prisoner swap with Kyiv in late June.
Last week Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 144 prisoners of war each  the biggest exchange since the start of Moscows Ukraine campaign launched on February 24.
According to its statement, one of the soldiers said Ukrainian medics treated him without anaesthetic and that he was beaten, tortured with electricity in captivity.
The Russian Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said in a statement that it was verifying facts of inhuman treatment of Russia soldier prisoners in Ukraine.
Another injured Russian soldier, who had his left amputated, said he was badly beaten and had his wound irritated by Ukrainian medics, the statement said.
The testimonies of the freed Russian soldiers are examples of violations of the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, the Russian committee said.
