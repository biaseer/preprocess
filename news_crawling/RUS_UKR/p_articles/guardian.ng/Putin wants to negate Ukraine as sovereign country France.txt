It is the Russian president who took the decision to completely violate international law, to trample on international law, and to contribute to the fact that we are now no longer talking about shared peace in Europe but rather how we can continue to avoid a war.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin no longer accepted Ukraines independence under international law.
Baerbock accused Putin of lying about his intentions in Ukraine in talks with Western leaders in recent days.
In general, he is not keeping his promises, neither in public nor in private, whether to President Emmanuel Macron or to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, he said, referring to the French and German leaders.
Baerbock said the West was prepared for all scenarios including a full Russian invasion of Ukraine, adding that sanctions already agreed with European partners can be increased at any time.
President Putin in his speech on Monday declared in a sense the negation of Ukraine as a sovereign country, he told reporters after talks with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock in Berlin.
When or how should we believe what President Putin says? I dont know if anyone knows.
Le Drian said Putins decision to recognise two breakaway regions in Ukraine smacked of revisionism and a bid to reinvent history.
When asked about the likelihood of a full Russian invasion, Le Drian said that with 140,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraines borders anything is possible, including the worst.
When you do the opposite of what you said a week ago then you didnt tell the truth or, in plain German: you lied, she told reporters.
