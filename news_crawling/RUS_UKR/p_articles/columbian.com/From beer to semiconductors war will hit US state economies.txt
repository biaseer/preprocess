The odds are much better than even that we actually do experience a recession in that scenario, chief economist Mark Zandi said.
While the U.S. has limited trade ties with Russia and Ukraine, businesses from beer breweries in Missouri to semiconductor plants in California would see an impact, as prolonged combat and even harsher sanctions constrict supplies and drive up global prices for oil and other critical materials.
Some states would fare better than others, according to the analysis of effects of a military conflict that extends into next year.
Models are very good in typical times, he said. In highly stressed and very unusual environments, the world goes what I would call non-linear and things go off the rails.
A Moodys Analytics computer model suggests that the U.S. as a whole would be able to avoid a recession, even if military hostilities are prolonged. But Zandi has his doubts.
An extended conflict between Russia and Ukraine would hit the U.S. economy broadly, with all 50 states affected by the fallout, according to an analysis by Moodys Analytics.
Energy producers such as North Dakota and Alaska stand out in that regard, with a lengthy conflict boosting oil prices to $150 a barrel as Russia reduces energy supplies to Europe. On the flip side, Alabama and Mississippi  the two states most dependent on cars and driving  would suffer disproportionately from an energy shock.
The analysis, by Moodys Analytics senior regional economist Adam Kamins, shows that an extended war would hurt U.S. states and localities in a variety of ways, some of them not immediately apparent.
