"We have a lot of contact with our customers in Ukraine. Uncertainty is high," says Dutch fresh produce exporter Lennart van den Heuvel of Hoofdman Roodzant. "Above all, peace is now required and we will have to wait and see how it develops. We are now suspending a number of loads."
No changesThere appear to be no changes for the time being to and from other Eastern European countries surrounding Ukraine. Mandersloot's Expeditiebedrijf, located in Scherpenzeel, does not provide transport to Ukraine, but the company is active in Eastern Europe and Commercial Group Manager Willem van Leuveren sees that tension and uncertainty in neighbouring countries such as Romania and Poland are increasing. In terms of transport, however, he has not noticed any changes to Eastern Europe for the time being.
This morning Europe woke up to the news of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In an unprecedentedly rapid development, the threatening situation has now escalated into a military conflict. In addition to tensions, uncertainties and personal suffering in Eastern Europe, it is also becoming clear that the influences of the situation will be felt in Western Europe and shipments are already being suspended.
TransportationIt is expected that transport to and from Ukraine will suffer from the situation. For example, Russia has suspended commercial shipping in the Sea of Azov. The northern shore of the Sea of Azov is Ukrainian, and the inland sea is connected to the Black Sea by a strait.
Top fruit from ChinaThe conflict has also led to shifts in trade flows. Yesterday, Russia announced that it will open its borders to Chinese apples and pears for the first time since 2019. According to USDA figures for 20172018, China has historically been Russia's third largest supplier of apples and pears.
