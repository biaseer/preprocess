Accordingly, despite the stabilization of the market, Belarus continues importing potatoes from Ukraine, but in smaller volumes.
The potato rush caused by active imports to Russia and Belarus during their own harvests has now gradually decreased. However, it has moved to the countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus. This does not mean that potato imports to Belarus and Russia have stopped, but rather indicates that the market has reached a point of balance between supply and demand.
However, the level where the price is fixed remains quite high. The wholesale price for potatoes in Belarus is two times higher than on the same date last year, and in Russia it is 2.1 times higher. At the same time, potatoes are more expensive in Russia  $0.48 versus $0.37 per kg in Belarus. For comparison, high-quality potatoes in Ukraine are now sold at $0.23 per kg, and in Moldova  at $0.20.
This was achieved by increasing the supply of locally produced potatoes and saturating the market with imported ones. As a result, potato prices in Belarus have remained stable for four weeks, and in Russia for three weeks.
