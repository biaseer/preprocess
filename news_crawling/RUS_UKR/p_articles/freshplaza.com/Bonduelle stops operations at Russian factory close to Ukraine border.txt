French vegetable group Bonduelle has halted operations at a factory in Russia near the Ukrainian border. Grgory Sanson, Bonduelles chief finance, digital transformation and development officer, has stated that the company had ceased activity at its site in Belgorod, located some 25 miles from the border.
Earlier today, Nestl said it had halted the manufacturing and distribution of its products in Ukraine.
Sanson said Bonduelles sales across Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States are around 150 mln a year. The company generates less than 10 mln in sales in Ukraine, he added.
Bonduelle has three factories in Russia but no manufacturing presence in Ukraine. Sanson: The one in Belgorod close to Ukraine border stopped running last evening to ensure the safety of people. Contingency plans have been enforced to ensure business continuity in the area.
