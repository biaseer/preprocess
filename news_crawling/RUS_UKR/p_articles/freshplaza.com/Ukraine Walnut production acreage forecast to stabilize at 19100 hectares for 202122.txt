Walnut production area in Ukraine is forecast to stabilize at 19,100 hectares ha for MY202122, following the slight decrease of production area down to 18,700 ha in MY202021.
FAS Kyiv has concluded that growing conditions until the beginning of September 2021 appear to be very favorable. Therefore, Post has forecast the MY202122 yield at a level higher than the two previous consecutive MYs. Any deterioration of growing conditions in late September and October 2021 should have little to no impact on yields in calendar year CY2021.
State Statistical Service of Ukraine SSSU data analysis suggests that the growth of production area was achieved through a continuing growth of new commercial orchard planting, outpacing the retirement of older, Soviet-era orchards. Similarly, yields from newly planted varieties, managed with improved production technologies using irrigation, fertilizers, and pest and disease control, have offset the declines in production volumes resulting from scaling down of old walnut orchards.
