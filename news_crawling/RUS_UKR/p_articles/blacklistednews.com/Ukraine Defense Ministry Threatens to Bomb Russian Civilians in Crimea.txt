The Ukrainian government is threatening to commit war crimes again.On Thursday, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry released a video on Twitter threatening Russian civilians that they may be bombed if they vacation in Crimea. The video shows women and children running for their lives after the alleged Ukrainian strike on Saki airbase in Crimea earlier this week. "Unless they want an unpleasantly hot summer break, we advise our valued russian guests not to visit Ukrainian Crimea," the MoD said. "Because no amount of sunscreen will protect them from the hazardous effects of smoking in unauthorised areas."The video tells civilians, who voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in 2014, that "Crimea is Ukraine" and it's "time to head home" lest they be bombed.
