Speaking to TimesLIVE on the Durban leg of the protests, Katya Fedkina, a Ukrainian  who has been in SA for 16 years, said her father is still in the European country.
Association members  said they were ashamed of that decision, especially as it came during  Human Rights Month.
The association challenged the government to publicly and without reservation condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, allow visa-free entrance to the country to Ukrainians whose family members are temporarily or permanently living in SA and tell Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop this insane madness.
Thats the observation of Durbanite Michelle Morkel, who was showing her support for Ukraine in Sundays peaceful march against Russian invasion in Durban.
You know how we were during that week of looting? That fear is nothing compared to what they are going through.
The Ukrainian Association of SA held peaceful marches  at the weekend  Friday, Saturday and Sunday  in Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban against the  refusal of SA to condemn Russia for the war in Ukraine.  SA chose to abstain from voting on the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the  UN General Assembly.
