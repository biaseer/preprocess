Irpin residents scurried along pavements clutching children, luggage and pets as they made their way to waiting buses and cars that would take them further from the clashes.
Irpin, some 25km northwest of the capital, has seen intense fighting in recent days. Russia's military is closing in on the Kyiv, which was home to about 3.4 million people before the invasion sparked an exodus of civilians.
Ukrainians fleeing the town of Irpin just outside Kyiv were caught in shelling by Russian forces on Sunday and forced to dive for cover, Reuters witnesses said.
