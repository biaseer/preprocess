The region, home to the Russian Baltic Fleet and a deployment location for Russian nuclear-capable Iskander missiles, is sandwiched between NATO members Lithuania and Poland.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday he plans to discuss with state-owned Gazprom the possibility of boosting liquefied natural gas LNG supplies to the western exclave of Kaliningrad, Interfax news agency reported.
Putin launched an LNG import ship in Kaliningrad in January 2019, hailing it as energy security for the exclave against gas pipeline disruptions.
