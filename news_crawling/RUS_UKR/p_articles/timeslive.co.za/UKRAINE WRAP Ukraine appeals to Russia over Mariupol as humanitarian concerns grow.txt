Mariupols plight highlights what an international aid official in Ukraine said was a breakdown in the countrys humanitarian system.
Ukraine appealed to Russia on Tuesday to allow humanitarian supplies into Mariupol and let desperate civilians out of the besieged city, which President Volodymr Zelenskyy says has been devastated by Russian bombardment.
Officials in Mariupol said the port city on the Sea of Azov, which has a peacetime population of 400,000, has no food, medicine, power and running water.
