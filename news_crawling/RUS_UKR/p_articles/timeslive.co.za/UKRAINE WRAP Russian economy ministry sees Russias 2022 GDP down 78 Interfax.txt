The economy ministry currently expects Russia's 2022 inflation at 17.5 and the rouble currency to peak in the second quarter of 2022 before it weakens to 76 roubles per dollar towards the end of 2022, Interfax added, citing the ministry.
Russia expects gross domestic product GDP to contract by 7.8 in 2022, Interfax news agency quoted the economy ministry as saying on Tuesday, as the commodity-dependent economy takes a hit from Western sanctions.
