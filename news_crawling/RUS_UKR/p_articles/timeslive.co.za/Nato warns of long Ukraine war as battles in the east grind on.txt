"We must prepare for the fact that it could take years. We must not let up in supporting Ukraine," Stoltenberg was quoted as saying.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited Kyiv on Friday with an offer of training for Ukrainian forces, also said on Saturday it was important Britain provide support for the long haul, warning of a risk of "Ukraine fatigue" as the war drags on.
Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said supplying state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukrainian troops would boost the chance of freeing its eastern region of Donbas from Russian control, Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported.
"Even if the costs are high, not only for military support, also because of rising energy and food prices."
After failing to take the capital Kyiv early on in the war, Russian forces have focused efforts on trying to take complete control of the Donbas, parts of which were already held by Russian-backed separatists before the February 24 invasion.
The war in Ukraine could last for years, the head of Nato said on Sunday, calling for steadfast support from Ukraine's allies as Russian forces battle for territory in the country's east.
