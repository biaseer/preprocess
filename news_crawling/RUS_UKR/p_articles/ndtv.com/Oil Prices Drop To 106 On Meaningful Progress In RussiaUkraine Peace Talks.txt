While the benchmark Brent crude oil started Tuesday extending losses from the previous session, it rebounded and was up nearly 0.4 per cent to trade around $113 after falling as low as $109.97 a barrel earlier in the session.
"The results of today's meeting are sufficient for a meeting at the leaders' level," Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said, raising the possibility of a meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin that Russia had shot down as recently as Monday as being "counterproductive".
A Russian negotiator welcomed "meaningful" progress with Ukrainian representatives at peace talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul over a month after Russia invaded its neighbour.
Crude oil prices made a U-turn and dropped sharply, over 6 per cent, to about $106 a barrel after Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said, "the results of today's meeting are sufficient for a meeting at the leaders' level."
Sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine have curtailed oil supply and sent prices to 14-year highs earlier this month.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Turkey for the first face-to-face talks in nearly three weeks. The top Russian negotiator said the talks were "constructive".
The benchmark Brent crude futures fell over 6 per cent to about $106 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTI crude was down over 6 per cent at $99.6.
Both those contracts fell about 7 per cent on Monday, as Shanghai's two-stage lockdown offset concerns about tight supply over nine days which was expected to hit fuel demand in China, the world's largest oil importer.
