Washington's top diplomat and its defence secretary met Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in Kyiv late on Sunday, pledging new assistance worth $713 million for Zelensky's government and other countries in the region fearing Russian aggression.
Earlier in April, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery.

Russia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow's ambassador to Washington told Russian state television.
"We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice," Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
