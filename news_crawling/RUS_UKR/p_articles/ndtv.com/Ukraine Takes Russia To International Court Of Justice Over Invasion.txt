The Kremlin has tried to justify its operation to "demilitarise" Ukraine as an attempt to prevent the alleged persecution of the country's Russian-speaking minority.
"Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression," Zelensky declared in a tweet.
Ukraine has submitted its application against Russia to the ICJ. Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression. We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week.
But the international community has roundly condemned the invasion as a flagrant breach of international law, and many Ukrainian civilians have volunteered to defend their country.
"We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week," he said.

The ICJ, which is based in the Netherlands capital The Hague, does not have a mandate to bring criminal charges against individual Russian leaders behind the four-day-old invasion.
Ukraine has lodged a complaint against Russia at the International Court of Justice in The Hague to get it to halt its invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday.
But it is the world's top court for resolving legal complaints between states over alleged breaches of international law. It is the supreme judicial institution of the United Nations.
