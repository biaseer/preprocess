President Joe Biden on Thursday said the United States and its allies will support Ukraine "as long as it takes" to ensure the country is not defeated by Russia.
"Ukraine has already dealt a severe blow to Russia," Biden said, adding that he did not "know how it's going to end, but it will not end with a Russian defeat of Ukraine."
"We are going to stick with Ukraine, and all of the alliance are going to stick with Ukraine, as long as it takes to make sure they are not defeated by Russia," he said.
