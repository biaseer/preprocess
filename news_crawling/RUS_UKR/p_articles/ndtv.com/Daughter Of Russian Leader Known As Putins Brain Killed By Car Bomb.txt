Daria Dugina, born in 1992, was killed when a bomb placed in her Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway near the village of Bolshie Vyzyomy, some 40 kilometres 25 miles outside Moscow, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.
According to family members quoted by Russian media, Dugin -- a vocal supporter of Kremlin's offensive in Ukraine -- was the likely target of the blast as his daughter borrowed his car at the last minute.
He has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking territories in a vast new Russian empire and wholeheartedly supported Moscow's operation in Ukraine.
Dugina died on the scene and a homicide investigation has been opened, said the committee, which probes major crime cases in Russia.

Alexader Dugin Daughter Dies: Daria was killed when bomb placed in her Toyota Land Cruiser went off.
The daughter of Alexader Dugin, a hardline Russian ideologue close to President Vladimir Putin, has been killed in a car bombing on Moscow's outskirts, authorities said on Sunday.
The head of one of Ukraine's breakaway separatist regions blamed the blast on Kyiv authorities.
He was put on a Western sanctions list after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a move he also backed.
"The Ukrainian regime terrorists tried to liquidate Alexander Dugin, but blew up his daughter," DNR chief Denis Pushilin wrote on Telegram.
