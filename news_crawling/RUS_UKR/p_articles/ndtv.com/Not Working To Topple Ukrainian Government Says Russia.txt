Zakharova said another round of talks will be focused on humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.
Ukraine and Russia officials have been meeting on the Belarus-Poland border for talks to end fighting.
Russia and Ukraine have agreed a day-long ceasefire Wednesday around a series of evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape fighting.
The army's aim is "not to occupy Ukraine, or the destruction of its statehood, or the overthrow of the government. It is not directed against the civilian population," Zakharova said.
President Vladimir Putin has said he sent in troops to Ukraine in order to "de-Nazify" the country.
Russia said Wednesday that negotiations with Kyiv to resolve the Ukraine conflict were making headway and underscored that Moscow's troops were not working to topple the Ukrainian government.

The UN refugee agency UNHCR has estimated the total number of Ukraine refugees at as many as 2.2 million.
Moscow said this week it would set up evacuation corridors, but Kyiv said the proposed routes were unacceptable because some led to Russia.
"Some progress has been made," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said during a press briefing, referring to three rounds of talks with Kyiv.
"Persons wishing to leave for Russia are forced to evacuate in the Western direction," she said.
Since Russian troops went in on February 24, they have advanced into the country and shelled Ukraine's main cities, forcing thousands to flee.
