On February 24, Russia launched a special operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk requested help to defend them from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Ministry of Defense said the operation is solely targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only and the civilian population is not in danger.
The Pentagon official did not clarify what the official meant by "Georgia" since there are no Russian troops in this country. The Defense Department press centre did not immediately respond to Sputnik's inquiry on the issue.
