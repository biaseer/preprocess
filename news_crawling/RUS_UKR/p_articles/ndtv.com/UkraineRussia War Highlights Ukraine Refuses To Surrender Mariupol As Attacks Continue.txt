Mariupol has suffered some of the heaviest bombardments since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.
US President Joe Biden discussed Russia's "brutal" war in Ukraine in a  phone call with European allies Monday ahead of attending NATO and EU  summits, followed by a trip to Poland, in a crucial week for the West's  standoff with Moscow.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that a meeting with Russian  counterpart Vladimir Putin "in any format" is needed to stop the war in  Ukraine.
"I believe that without this  meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in  order to stop the war," Zelensky said in an interview with the Ukraine  regional media outlet Suspilne.
Ukraine on Monday rejected Russian calls to surrender the port city of Mariupol, where residents are besieged with little food, water and power and fierce fighting shows little sign of easing.
Russia earlier called on Ukrainian forces in Mariupol to lay down their arms, saying a "terrible humanitarian catastrophe" was unfolding.
The White House said  Biden hosted the call, lasting just under one hour, with French  President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime  Minister Mario Draghi and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson "to discuss  their coordinated responses."
