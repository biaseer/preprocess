The US and several Western countries have imposed crippling economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
"We are in the process of analysing its impact on India-Russia bilateral trade and economic cooperation, in consultation with all stakeholders. India's relations with Russia stand on their own merit," Ms Lekhi said.
"We have expressed deep concern at the worsening situation and called for an immediate cessation of violence and end to all hostilities," she said.
Ms Lekhi said India has reiterated that there is no other choice but the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve the crisis.
"We have emphasised to all member states of the UN that the global order is anchored on international law, UN Charter and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of states," she added.
