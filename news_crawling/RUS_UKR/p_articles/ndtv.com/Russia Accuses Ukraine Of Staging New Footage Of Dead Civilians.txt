Ukraine has blamed Russian forces, with Zelensky describing the killings as "war crimes" and "genocide".
"Similar events are now being organised by the Ukrainian special services in Sumy, Konotop and other cities," the Russian defence ministry said, referring to cities in northeastern Ukraine.
The Russian defence ministry made the assertion after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded tough new sanctions on Moscow over killings in the town of Bucha that have prompted international condemnation.

The Russian defence ministry said on Tuesday that the Ukrainian military recorded a fake video that purported to show "peaceful civilians allegedly killed by the Russian armed forces."
Moscow denies any responsibility, saying that the images are fake or that the deaths occurred after Russian forces pulled out of the area.
At the weekend, dozens of bodies, some with their hands bound behind them, were discovered in Bucha near Kyiv after the withdrawal of Russian troops.
The video was made on Monday evening in the settlement of Moshchun some 20 kilometres 12 miles northwest of Kyiv and was designed to be distributed through Western media, Moscow said.
Russia on Tuesday accused Ukraine of staging new civilian deaths in a number of locations in an effort to pin the blame on Moscow.
