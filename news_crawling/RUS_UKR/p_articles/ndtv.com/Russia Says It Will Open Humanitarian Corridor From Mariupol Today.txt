Zaporizhzhia lies some 220 kilometres 140 miles to the northwest of the port city on the Sea of Azov.
"To guarantee the success of this humanitarian operation, it has been suggested it be conducted with the direct participation of the representatives of the UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross," it added, referring first to the UN refugee agency.
The decision came after "a personal request from the French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz to Russian President Vladimir Putin", it said in a statement.
"The Russian armed forces will reopen a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia on April 1 from 10:00 am," or 0700 GMT, the Russian defence ministry said.
The ICRC said earlier it was preparing to facilitate the safe passage of civilians from Mariupol.
Aid groups say tens of thousands of civilians are trapped in the city with little food, water or medicine, but previous attempts to agree on a humanitarian corridor have failed, despite international pressure.
Ukraine said it was sending dozens of buses to evacuate civilians from Mariupol after a Russian ceasefire announcement.
