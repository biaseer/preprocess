Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops to pro-Western Ukraine on February 24, sending shockwaves across the world.

The army expects to receive more than two thousand units of military equipment and weapons, Shoigu added.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Moscow would create new military bases in western Russia in response to the expansion of NATO.
