This Saturday, SUN volunteers will be at the Vernon Square Safeway where they will be selling pop and hotdogs to raise funds to help those fleeing their war-torn homeland.
Simon Lutsenko is with the Slavic United Network SUN, a Vernon-based group that is dedicated to helping Ukraine refugees not only get to the region, but to adjust to life in a new country.
Lutsenko said refugees who find work and reach a certain level of English can apply for permanent residency.
Right now, we have six families en route. One is a mom and a child. Her husband couldn't get out of Ukraine, Lutsenko said. We have probably another 10 that are requesting to come here, but we don't really want to accept anybody until we have housing for them or a family that can sponsor them.
Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, eight families have fled to the safety of the Okanagan.
And with such a low vacancy rate on the region, housing is a significant challenge to overcome.
Lutsenko said SUN helps refugees with registration and then we help them with flights, with housing, with food, with essential needs. We will find them a rental, but they come with nothing so we furnish the rental.
Lutsenko said applications to SUN have slowed because there is a back log of visa applications in Poland and Germany, but applications are still coming in.
Refugees coming to the area can also benefit from the Vernon Community Futures Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot which was launched in February 2020.
The primary goal of the all-volunteer group is to help newcomers settling in the Okanagan to integrate into communities and become contributing members of society.
