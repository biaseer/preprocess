Our belief was that if we stepped up and donated 100 of the bottle sticker price, and not just the profits, then we could really get our craft spirits supporters to rally behind this cause. We didnt want to have our family benefit financially in any way from this initiative: we figured putting our money where our mouth is, by donating all funds, was the best way to hopefully convince people to be similarly inspired to help in their own way as the need is so great.
Our family was heartbroken by the images coming out of Ukraine and decided to help out in a way that we thought could generate the largest amount of benefit in the shortest possible time, said distillery CEO Tyler Dyck.
In a somewhat ironic twist, a Vernon-based distillery used Russia's most popular spirit to raise money for Ukraine.
In a move worth raising a toast to, the distillery served up a $25,466 donation.
In an effort to help Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion, Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery donated proceeds from the sale of every bottle of vodka from its family distillery throughout March to the Ukraine Emergency fund through Canada's branch of the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR.
The distillery included all revenues raised from the sale of any of its vodkas through private liquor stores, lounges and restaurants, as well as to individual buyers in their final tabulations and will be making the donation to UNHCR this week.
