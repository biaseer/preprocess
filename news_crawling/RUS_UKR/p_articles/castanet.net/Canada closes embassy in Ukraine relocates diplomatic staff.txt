Canada has shuttered its embassy in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and relocated its diplomatic staff to a temporary office in the western part of the country amid fears of a war with Russia.
Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly announced the move this afternoon in a statement that blamed Russia for the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine.
Russia has mobilized 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and is demanding a series of concessions from the NATO military alliance, which includes Canada.
A summary of the conversation from the Prime Minister's Office said Trudeau emphasized Canada's support for Ukraine and promised a Russian invasion would be met with economic sanctions.
While Russia has denied wanting a war, diplomatic talks between Moscow and the West have failed to resolve the standoff and NATO leaders have started warning of a conflict in Ukraine.
Joly announced the closure of the embassy in Kyiv shortly after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
