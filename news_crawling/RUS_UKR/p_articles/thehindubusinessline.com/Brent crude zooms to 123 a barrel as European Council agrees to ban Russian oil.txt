European Council posted on its Website that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia will cover crude oil, as well as petroleum products, delivered from Russia to member states. A temporary exception for crude oil delivered by pipeline will be made. In case of sudden interruptions of supply, emergency measures will be introduced to ensure security of supply, European Council said.
It said the leaders urged the Council of the European Union to finalise and adopt the new sanctions without delay, ensuring a well-functioning EU single market, fair competition, solidarity among member states, and a level-playing field for phasing out EU dependency on Russian fossil fuels.
Another factor that will push the demand for the crude oil is the relaxation of Covid-induced lockdown norms in China as it is gradually opening up its cities. China is a major consumer of crude oil in the global market.
