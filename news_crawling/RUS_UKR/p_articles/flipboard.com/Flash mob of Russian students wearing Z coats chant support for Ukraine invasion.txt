Russian students have taken part in a patriotic flash mob in support of the Ukraine invasion. Footage shared online shows a group of people chanting forward Russia and saluting while they wear coats featuring the Z symbol seen on tanks and military vehicles throughout the war. The group can also be heard chanting Russia for peace as they gathered in a shopping mall in Kazan, showing support for Vladimir Putins forces as they continue to shell schools and hospitals in Ukraine.
