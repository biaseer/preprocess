Mr Ramsay  was elected to the position unanimously at a meeting on Wednesday May 11, the first meeting of the council since the elections.
The former Senedd Member for Monmouth and Liberal Democrat candidate for Raglan in the recent local elections, Nick Ramsay is the new chair of Raglan Community Council.
I wish to pay tribute to my predecessor Adrian Merrett who has chaired the council diligently and with passion over the last year.
As a resident of Raglan for the last 20 years I care passionately about the village and surrounding area.
Speaking today, Mr Ramsay said: Its a privilege to be elected as the new chair of Raglan Community Council.
I look forward to working with the other members of the council and the clerking team over the weeks and months ahead to provide leadership on the issues that matter to residents of Raglan and neighbouring villages.
