The event takes place on May 15 and has five different walks on offer with distances to suit everybody from 3.5 miles up to 13 miles.
After such a dry Spring, the paths are in excellent condition and in many areas lined with bluebells and the white flowers of wild garlic.
The event, raising funds for the Velindre breast cancer research team, is based at Monmouth Show Ground, where bacon rolls and burgers will be available at the start of all walks, and ice cream to welcome walkers back when they complete their walks.
If you havent already signed up, registration is open until May 13 at www.walkthewye.com where you can also find event details.
There is a good response for this years Walk The Wye, with entrants from as far afield as Pembroke, Worcester and Swindon already signed up.
All walks use the well-trodden footpaths of the Wye valley, with good views of the river and distant hills. Walk start times are staggered to allow social distancing guidelines to be met.
