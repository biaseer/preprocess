The Duke of Cambridge made a private visit to MI6  just hours before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine.
In 2019, William spent three weeks working with MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to learn how the UKs security and intelligence agencies work.
It is understood the visit had been in Williams diary for a number of weeks.
Second in line to the throne William visited the Secret Intelligence Service, which deals with foreign intelligence and protects the UK from risks abroad, in London on Wednesday morning.
The visit was not publicised beforehand, as is the case with private engagements, and only appeared afterwards in the Court Circular.
These agencies are full of people from everyday backgrounds doing the most extraordinary work to keep us safe.
We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues. The ability to comment on our stories is a privilege, not a right, however, and that privilege may be withdrawn if it is abused or misused.
It is not known whether the duke met the head of MI6, Richard Moore, known in Whitehall as C.
He said then: Spending time inside our security and intelligence agencies, understanding more about the vital contribution they make to our national security, was a truly humbling experience.
