Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.
Reuters      Moscow and Kyiv are halfway there in agreeing on the issue of Ukraines demilitarisation, and their views are most aligned on Ukraines neutrality and giving up on joining NATO, Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky was quoted as saying on Friday.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in an effort to degrade its southern neighbours military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.
Interfax news agency quoted Medinsky as saying negotiating teams trying to agree on ending hostilities in Ukraine were discussing nuances of security guarantees should Ukraine no longer attempt to join the Western military alliance.
