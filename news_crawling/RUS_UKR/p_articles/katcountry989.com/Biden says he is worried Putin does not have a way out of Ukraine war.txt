Biden said Putin is a very calculating man and the problem he worries about now is that the Russian leader doesnt have a way out right now, and Im trying to figure out what we do about that.
Biden, speaking at a political fundraiser in a Washington suburb, said Putin had mistakenly believed the invasion of Ukraine would break up NATO and break up the European Union.
Russias assault on Kyiv was beaten back in March by strong Ukrainian resistance. Russia, which calls the invasion a special military operation, poured more troops into Ukraine for a huge offensive last month in the eastern part of the country but its gains have been slow.
POTOMAC, Md. Reuters      U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he is worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not have a way out of the Ukraine war, and Biden said he was trying to figure out what to do about that.
