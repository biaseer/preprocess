The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Russian military leaders and people it accused of being connected to human rights violations while imposing fresh measures on Moscows close ally Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
We both agreed it is important to ensure safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine, Kuleba added in his tweet.
They also discussed ongoing diplomatic efforts to stop the war that began with Russias invasion of Ukraine in late February, according to the State Department.
Kuleba tweeted after his call with Blinken that he welcomed the new round of personal sanctions against Russian officials but added that there was need to step up economic pressure on Russia.
