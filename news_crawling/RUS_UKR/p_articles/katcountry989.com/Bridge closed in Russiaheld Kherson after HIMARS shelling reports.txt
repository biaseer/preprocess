Reuters      Authorities in the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Kherson have closed the citys only bridge across the Dnieper river after it came under fire from U.S.-supplied high mobility artillery rocket systems HIMARS, according to Interfax and TASS reports on Wednesday.
A Ukrainian counteroffensive to recapture the southern region from Russia could potentially benefit from the destruction of the bridge.
The Antonovsky bridge has been closed for civilians but its structural integrity has not suffered from the shelling, Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-appointed city administration, told Interfax.
