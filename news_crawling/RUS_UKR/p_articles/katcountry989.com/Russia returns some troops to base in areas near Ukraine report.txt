Although Moscow has denied ever planning to attack Ukraine, it has demanded legally binding guarantees from the United States and NATO that Kyiv will not be allowed to join the military bloc. Washington and Brussels have so far refused to make such pledges.
Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops near Ukraines borders, prompting fears of an invasion, especially as Moscows Feb. 10-20 joint drills with Belarus mean that Ukraine is almost encircled by the Russian military.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was expected nL8N2UP5M2 in Moscow later on Tuesday to meet President Vladimir Putin in a high stakes mission to avert war.
Russian markets reacted positively to the news and the rouble, which has been under pressure due to fears of fresh Western sanctions in the event of a war, gained 1.5 shortly after the defence ministry announcement.
Russias Interfax news agency cited the ministry as saying that while large-scale drills across the country continued, some units of the Southern and Western military districts have completed their exercises and started returning to base.
MOSCOW Reuters -Some troops in Russias military districts adjacent to Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills, Russias defence ministry was quoted as saying on Tuesday, a move that could de-escalate frictions between Moscow and the West.
