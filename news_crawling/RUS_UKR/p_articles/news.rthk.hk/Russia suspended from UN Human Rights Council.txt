"Such a hasty move at the General Assembly, which forces countries to choose sides, will aggravate the division among member states, intensify the confrontation between the parties concerned  it is like adding fuel to the fire," Beijing's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said ahead of the vote.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also called for Russia to be expelled from the UN Security Council "so it cannot block decisions about its own aggression, its own war".
The UN General Assembly on Thursday voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council as punishment for its attack on Ukraine.
The US argues that this punishment  suspending Russia from the Geneva-based organisation that is the UN's main human rights monitor  is more than symbolic and in fact intensifies Russia's isolation after the assault on Ukraine that began on February 24.

Despite pressure from Moscow for a no vote, several African countries only abstained, such as South Africa and Senegal. Also abstaining were Brazil, Mexico and India.
Other countries voting against included, Iran, the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan and Cuba, as well as Russia itself, Belarus and Syria.
Of the 193 members of the assembly, 93 voted in favour of suspension as proposed by the United States, while 24 voted against and 58 abstained, suggesting weakening international unity against Russia at the United Nations.
It was the second ever suspension of a country from the council. Libya was the first, in 2011.
