MOSCOW. March 17 Interfax - Supplies of weapons, including S-300 air defense missile systems, from the United States to Ukraine might have dangerous consequences, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.
"And as for long-term prospects, this step could have far more dangerous consequences," Zakharova said.
"Such statements are extremely dangerous, and such supplies, as already has been said by presidential officials, would be a destabilizing factor, which certainly won't bring peace to Ukraine," she said.
"This is consistent with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's absolutely thoughtless and soulless policy with regard to his own people and, in principle, Ukraine," Zakharova said at a press briefing in Moscow on Thursday, when asked to comment on Zelensky's request for the U.S. to supply S-300 or analogous air defense missile systems to Ukraine.
