LONDON. Jan 24 Interfax - The United Kingdom is partially withdrawing its diplomatic staff and their families from Ukraine due to "the growing threat from Russia," the British government said in a statement on its website on Monday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of State authorized on Sunday "the voluntary departure of U.S. direct hire employees USDH and ordered the departure of eligible family members EFM from Embassy Kyiv due to the continued threat of Russian military action."
EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said earlier on Monday he saw no reason to withdraw diplomats and their families from Ukraine.
"The British Embassy remains open and will continue to carry out essential work," it said.
"Some Embassy staff and dependants are being withdrawn from Kyiv in response to growing threat from Russia," the statement said.
