"I know for an absolute fact that the U.S. is running around the world via its ambassadors, forcing any countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia to do at least something against the Russian Federation," Lavrov said in an interview with Al Jazeera.
MOSCOW. March 2 Interfax - The United States is trying to convince countries of Asia, Latin America and Africa to take measures against Russia in light of the events in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday.
"It's dishonorable and unworthy. But we are used to it. It has happened more than once in our history when partners acted based on dishonorable beliefs and by dishonorable methods. We can handle this. I am 100 sure," Lavrov said.
