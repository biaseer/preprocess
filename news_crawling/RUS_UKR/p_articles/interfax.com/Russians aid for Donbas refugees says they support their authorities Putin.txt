MOSCOW. March 10 Interfax - The aid sent to refugees from Donbas by ordinary Russians means the latter support their government, President Vladimir Putin said.
"I would like to address our citizens, those who are helping refugees, to thank all Russian citizens who show so much sympathy with those who need our help and support. For the endless long eight years those people refugees had to live in basements, kids who have grown up already, go to school, they have lived in these conditions with rats for eight years now. It was really simply our duty: to support those people, to help them. There was no other way we were left with no other chance to resolve this issue in some other way," Putin told the government on Thursday.
"It says that we are doing the right thing, that we support Donbas," Putin said.
And the fact that Russians help the refugees so much "suggests that by and large our people support" the actions of Russian authorities, he said.
