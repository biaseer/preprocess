MOSCOW. Feb 25 Interfax - People detained during unsanctioned protests against the Russian military operation in Ukraine on Thursday had no right to be there, since such participation requires compliance with certain procedures, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
"The president hears everyone's opinion and understands the ratio of those who think differently to those who look at the forced operation with understanding," he said.
"By law, these citizens have no right to hold demonstrations and express their viewpoint unless they comply with certain procedures. There are solo pickets but such events, I would call them massive, involving a certain number of people, are simply not allowed by law. Therefore, certain measures have been taken in their the citizens' regard," Peskov said at a press briefing on Friday.
"Indeed, there are citizens entitled to an opinion of their own. On the other hand, we should give better explanations to such citizens this is also pretty obvious," Peskov said.
