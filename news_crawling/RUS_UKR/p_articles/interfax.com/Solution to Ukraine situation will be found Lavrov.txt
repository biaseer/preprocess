MOSCOW. March 3 Interfax - A solution to the Ukraine situation will be found, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.
"We can no longer let Ukraine pose a threat of direct attack on the Russian Federation threats of this type are being written into the current doctrinal documents of the Kyiv regime. There is, of course, Ukraine's unquenchable ambition to join NATO and NATO's total reluctance to honor its own obligation not to adopt any measures which will strengthen 'your security at the expense of mine'," Lavrov said.
"They must be receiving instructions from Washington I do not doubt that. This is a completely dependent country. Still, talks are due to be held," Lavrov said.
"Of course, a solution will be found. I have no doubt about that. We are aware of the minimal terms, and they are being discussed, in particular, at negotiations with the Ukrainian side, which were held in Gomel and are due to continue today," Lavrov said at a press briefing on Thursday.
