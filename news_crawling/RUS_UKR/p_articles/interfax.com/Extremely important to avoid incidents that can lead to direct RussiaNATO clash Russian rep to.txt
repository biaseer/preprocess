"The matter is not only about the fact that such steps are absolutely inconsistent with calls for peace heard from those same countries. Supplying the Kyiv regime with weapons that can be used against Russian military service members and civilians poses categorically unacceptable risks. We believe it is extremely important now to avoid situations and incidents that could lead to a direct clash between Russia and NATO," he said.
MOSCOW. March 4 Interfax - Moscow considers it extremely important at present to avoid incidents that could lead to a direct clash between Russia and NATO, Russian Permanent Representative to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe OSCE Alexander Lukashevich said.
"We view the statements being made by a number of NATO countries on preparing new military supplies to Ukraine, this time around lethal weapons, as a continuation of the irresponsible policy aimed at directly fueling a military escalation in Ukraine," the Russian Foreign Ministry quoted Lukashevich as saying at a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, which dealt with Ukraine's crimes against civilians and an unacceptable response by Western countries to Russia's special military operation.
