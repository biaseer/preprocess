These include restrictions on economic relations with Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, as well as the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics DPR and LPR, individual restrictive measures, i.e. asset freezes and travel restrictions, on a broad range of individuals and entities, and diplomatic measures, the Council said.
In addition to economic sanctions, the EU has also hit Russia with "different types of measures in response to Russia's destabilizing actions against Ukraine."
"The Council today decided to prolong by six months, until 31 January 2023, the restrictive measures targeting specific sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation," the Council said in a statement on Tuesday.
These sanctions, first introduced on July 31, 2014 for one year in response to "Russia's actions destabilizing the situation in Ukraine," were significantly expanded since February 2022, after the start of Russia's special operation in Ukraine.
"They currently consist of a broad spectrum of sectoral measures, including restrictions on finance, energy, technology and dual-use goods, industry, transport and luxury goods," it said.
