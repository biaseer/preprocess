KYIV. March 18 Interfax-Ukraine - Ukraine is actively holding talks and consultations with European and U.S. partners on the possibility of restricting Russian gas shipments to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, head of the Ukrainian Gas Transmission System GTS Operator Serhiy Makohon told the ICTV television channel on Friday.
"We welcome the sanctions imposed on Nord Stream 2 and propose restricting Nord Stream 1, because Poland and Ukraine currently have the available capacity to ensure an additional volume of transit through our gas pipeline," Makohon said.
Maintaining Russian gas transit via the Gas Transmission System of Ukraine in today's conditions is an extremely important factor, which serves as an additional guarantee for preserving the gas transport infrastructure of Ukraine, he said.
The amount of Russian gas transit via the GTS of Ukraine has been 109 million cubic meters per day since February 24, which is consisted with the contracted volumes, he said.
