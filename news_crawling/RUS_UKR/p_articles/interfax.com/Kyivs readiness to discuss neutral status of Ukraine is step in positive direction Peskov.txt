As to what the Kremlin is expecting from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who declared the readiness to discuss neutral status for Ukraine, Peskov said, "I answered this question yesterday and would rather not repeat myself. I have nothing to add on this subject."
He abstained from commenting on a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who doubted that Zelensky was actually ready to discuss Ukraine's neutrality.
MOSCOW. Feb 25 Interfax - Kyiv's statements on the readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine with Moscow have been duly noted, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
"This is a new statement. We have paid attention to it. This seems to be a step in the positive direction. We have yet to analyze it. There is nothing I can add for now," Peskov said.
