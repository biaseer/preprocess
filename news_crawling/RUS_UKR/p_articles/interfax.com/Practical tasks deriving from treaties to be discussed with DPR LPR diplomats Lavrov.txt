Russia views Kyiv's treatment of the Donbas population as genocide, Lavrov said. "Through all these years, the population of your republics has been harassed and attacked on a daily basis by the Kyiv regime, which has openly taken the path of Russophobia and genocide," he said.
"This is our first meeting. Obviously, we will focus on the discussion of practical tasks that derive from the treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance concluded between Russia and your countries," Lavrov said at a meeting with LPR Foreign Minister Vladislav Deinego and DPR First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Peresada.
