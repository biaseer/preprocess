MOSCOW. June 2 Interfax - Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has admitted that some partners "are putting pressure on Kyiv" in order to persuade it to hold negotiations with Russia, but they are not "key" partners.
"It is indeed true, but they do not represent the most influential countries of the world. None of our key partners - neither in North America nor in Europe - pursues such a position," Kuleba said during the national telethon on Wednesday.
"It is consumers of Ukrainian grain who try to push the agenda that you have mentioned. At first, they talked a lot of how much they love Ukraine, of how they support it, of how they are sorry that all those things are happening, but then they say, if one translates it from diplomatic language to ordinary language, that 'we don't care how you do it, but, above all, bring us what we need to feed people'," the Ukrainian media quoted Kuleba as saying.
