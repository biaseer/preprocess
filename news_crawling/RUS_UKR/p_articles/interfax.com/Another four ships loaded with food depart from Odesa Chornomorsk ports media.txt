The ships, carrying sunflower oil, oil cake and corn, sailed out of Odesa and Chornomorsk, the ministry said.

Today, we are expecting five vessels to enter the Chornomorsk port, which is the largest daily number since the 'grain corridor' was opened. We need to maintain this pace in order to be able to transship more than three million tonnes every month, receiving some 100 vessels a month," head of the Ukrainian Sea Port Authority Oleksiy Vostrikov said.
