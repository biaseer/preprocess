"We need to move from words that Ukraine is part of the European family to action. In the coming weeks, the European Union can take a historic step that will prove that the words about the Ukrainian people's belonging to the European family are not empty," the Ukrainian media quoted Zelensky as saying at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, which he attended by video link.
MOSCOW. June 10 Interfax - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on democratic countries to support Ukraine not only in word but also in deed.
Ukraine needs efficient and legally-binding security guarantees and an updated security architecture for the European continent, he said.
"Why are there skeptics who are hesitant to allow us to move to the European Union? Why? Why have the Ukrainian people been told for so long that they must remain in the gray zone between the European Union and Russia? Why?" he said.
