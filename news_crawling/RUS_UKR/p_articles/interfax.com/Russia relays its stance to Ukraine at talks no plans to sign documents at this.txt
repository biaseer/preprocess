"For now, there is no discussion of any documents. Once again, the talks were a good opportunity to clearly relay our vision of the problem to the Ukrainian side," Peskov said at a press briefing on Friday.
MOSCOW. March 4 Interfax - There are no plans to sign any documents at the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations at this point, yet the stance of Russia has been relayed to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
"We believe it would be premature to make further assessments just yet. We have no doubt that, of course, such talks should be held quietly given the circumstances they should not be public," Peskov said.
