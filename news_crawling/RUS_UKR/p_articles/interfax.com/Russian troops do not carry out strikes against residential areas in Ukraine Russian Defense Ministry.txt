"We urged the residents of Ukraine: demand that the criminal government in Kyiv take all heavy weapons away from your homes and residential quarters of towns," he said.
"The Russian armed forces do not carry out any strikes against residential quarters," the ministry's spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said at a briefing on Saturday.
MOSCOW. Feb 26 Interfax - The Russian military do not carry out strikes against residential areas during the operation in Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
"Our intelligence data continue showing Ukrainian nationalists deploying rocket and artillery units to residential areas, and not just in Kyiv but in other Ukrainian cities as well. We repeat: this is done deliberately to provoke the Russian military into counterstrikes against civilians in the populated areas. The Ukrainian nationalist leaders apply the same methods as terrorists," Konashenkov said.
"The Ukrainian leadership has repeatedly denied using civilians as a human shield and putting heavy weaponry in towns. Such blatant lie can only entail grave consequences. Watch the numerous videos from Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities now circulating both mass media and the Internet," he said.
