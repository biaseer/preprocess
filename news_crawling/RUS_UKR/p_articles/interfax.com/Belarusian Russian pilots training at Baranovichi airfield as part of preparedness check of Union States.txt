The exercise is continuing amid the Russian special military operation against Ukraine and the exacerbation of Russia-NATO relations.
The Union Resolve 2022 exercise of Russia and Belarus began on February 10. The largescale exercise, which involved certain Russian formations and units of the Eastern Military District, was supposed to end on February 20. Moscow and Minsk said that Russian troops would go back to base when the exercise was over.
Still, Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin said on Sunday that the presidents of Belarus and Russia had chosen to extend the preparedness check amid the intensifying military activity on the Union State border and the escalating tensions in Donbas.
MINSK. Feb 25 Interfax - Belarusian and Russian pilots are taking part in the preparedness check of the Union State's rapid response forces at the Baranovichi airfield of the 61st Airbase, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said on Friday.
