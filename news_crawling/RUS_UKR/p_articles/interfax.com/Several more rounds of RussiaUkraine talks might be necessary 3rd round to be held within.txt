MOSCOW. March 4 Interfax - Russia and Ukraine will need another one to several more rounds of negotiations, State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee head Leonid Slutsky said.
"Some issues will be resolved, and agreements will be reached, which, among other things, would require parliamentary diplomacy efforts to take effect," he said.
"Perhaps from one to several more rounds will yet be necessary. The third round will be held in the near future," Slutsky told journalists following the second round of the negotiations with Ukraine, which took place in the Brest region of Belarus on Thursday.
