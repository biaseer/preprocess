"By lodging a claim with the International Court in regard to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Ukraine has obviously abused its jurisdiction. The court does not have jurisdiction over this particular claim, and we will continue to defend this obvious fact," the Russian Foreign Ministry website quoted Zakharova as saying.
Meanwhile,Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that the International Court of Justice has no jurisdiction over the Ukraine vs. Russia claim, and Moscow will continue to insist on that.
MOSCOW. March 17 Interfax - Moscow cannot take into consideration the order by the International Court of Justice that Russia halt the hostilities in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
"No, we cannot take this order into consideration. The International Court of Justice has such a notion as 'the consent of the sides'. There can be no consent here," Peskov said in response to the relevant question from journalists.
