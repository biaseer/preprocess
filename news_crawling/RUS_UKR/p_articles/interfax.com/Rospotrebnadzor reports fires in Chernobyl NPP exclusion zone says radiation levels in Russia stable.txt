MOSCOW. March 28 Interfax - Radiation levels remain stable in Russia despite fires in the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's health and consumer rights protection watchdog, said in a statement.
"A lot of old information, dating a few weeks back, has been repeated lately. As of now, the fire situation in the Chernobyl zone is more or less stable, and there are no big fires burning," Denysenko said during a television marathon.
"Given the fires in the Chernobyl NPP exclusion zone, Rospotrebnadzor has been monitoring radiation levels in border areas of Russia," the agency said.
The State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management said on social media earlier that the radiation hazard had grown due to fires in the Chernobyl NPP exclusion zone that had the potential to spread. The agency said that fires observed at over 30 spots in the exclusion zone over the past two weeks had exceeded 8,700 hectares in total.
Vadym Denysenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister, said on Monday that the fire situation in the Chernobyl NPP exclusion zone was generally stable.
