Issues with food supplies have been observed recently in a number of areas around the world. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen attributes the threat of a food crisis to Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, and other Western leaders have expressed similar views.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the West is neglecting the basic principles of the global economy, thus resulting in the economic crisis becoming chronic. There are noticeable difficulties in ensuring global food security, and prices for grain crops and other basic agricultural products are rising.
"The UK will allocate up to 10 million pounds sterling for materials and equipment for Ukrainian Railways in order to repair rail infrastructure and for assistance in exporting grain from the country by railway," according to the statement.
As noted, the UK is in talks with Ukraine's government on how "to maximize the capacity of the railways and ensure the movement of both trains and grain."
LONDON. June 27 Interfax - Britain intends to allocate up to 10 million pounds sterling, or $12.28 million, in order to repair Ukrainian Railways and to facilitate the export of grain from the country, the office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.
