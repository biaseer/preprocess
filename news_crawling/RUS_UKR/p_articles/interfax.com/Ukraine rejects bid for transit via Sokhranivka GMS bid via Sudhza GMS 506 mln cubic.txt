MOSCOW. May 12 Interfax - Ukraine's Gas Transmission System Operator GTSOU rejected Thursday's request for Russian gas transit through the Sohranivka gas metering station GMS, which accounts for about one-third of Ukraine's transit.
GTSOU on May 10 announced a force majeure, making it impossible to continue to transport gas through the Sohranivka gas measuring station and the Novopskov border compressor station, which are located in the Luhansk region.
Gazprom  official Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters: "Gazprom  is supplying Russian gas for transit through Ukraine in the volume confirmed by the Ukrainian side through the Suraja gas metering station - 50.6 million cubic meters as of May 12. The application for the Sohranivka gas metering system was rejected".
"Gazprom  supplies Russian gas for transit through Ukraine in the volume confirmed by the Ukrainian side through the Sudzha gas metering station - 50.6 million cubic meters as of 12 May. The bid for the Sohranivka GMS was rejected," Gazprom's official spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters.
The reduction in gas flows drove European gas price up 14 to $1,1651,000 cubic meters for June TTF futures on the ICE Futures exchange.
GTSOU data indicate that the bid for transit via the Sudzha GMS is 53.19 million cubic meters after booking of 73.4 million cubic meters on Wednesday.
