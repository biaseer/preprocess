"And despite all the difficulties of the present day, Russia assumed certain obligations as part of this contract and will certainly fulfill them completely," Putin said.
MOSCOW. July 14 Interfax - Russia intends to fully meet its obligations on the contract to transport natural gas through Ukraine and this issue should not be linked to the problem of Donbass or the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, President Vladimir Putin said.
"We signed a contract for five years to pump a certain amount of Russian natural gas to our customers in Europe through the territory of Ukraine. The Normandy format, other similar formats are political forums for discussing the situation in southeastern Ukraine. This has nothing to do with commercial projects such as Nord Stream, Nord Stream 2 or transit of our gas through Ukrainian territory," Putin said on TV channel Rossiya24 on Tuesday, commenting on his article "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians."
