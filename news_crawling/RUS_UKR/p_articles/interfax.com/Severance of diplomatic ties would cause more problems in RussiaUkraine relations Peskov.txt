MOSCOW. Feb 22 Interfax - The severance of diplomatic relations between Russia and Ukraine would create extra problems in normalizing bilateral relations, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would consider the possibility of breaking off diplomatic ties between Ukraine and Russia.
"If you assume a responsible position, if you treat each other with respect, if you keep your word, if you deliver on your obligation, if you don't attack your own citizens, then everything is possible," he said.
