"What's the point in asking questions if you already have an answer? And it seems to me that this is what makes this dialogue difficult, thus far," he said.
"But there are things on which there is no compromise. Just because you can't leave saying: yes, this is your country, Ukraine is part of Russia. That's just impossible! Why offer us that?" he said.
The Ukrainian-Russian dialogue involves "things on which we should reach some compromises, so that people shouldn't be dying," Zelensky said.
The Ukrainian delegation stands ready to discuss any subjects, but "the Russian side formulated answers to their own questions long ago," Zelensky said.
"Any negotiations make sense. Any word is more important that a shot. If you can speak first before you shoot, do so. I live according to such principles," Zelensky told foreign journalists on Thursday.
KYIV. March 4 Interfax - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he believes the Ukrainian-Russian negotiations in Belarus do make sense to him.
