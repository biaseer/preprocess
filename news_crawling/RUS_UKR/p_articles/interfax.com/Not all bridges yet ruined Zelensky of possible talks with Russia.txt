KYIV. May 11 Interfax-Ukraine - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that it is possible to resolve the conflict by diplomatic methods.
"Victory for me is not to lose 11 million people, so that 5 million people who have gone abroad will return back home. Victory for me is to restore the country economically to what it was before February 24 at the very least. Victory for me is to ensure that the Western world is fully aware of what is happening.  Victory for me is Ukraine's accession to the EU," he said.
"I was elected the president of Ukraine, not of 'mini-Ukraine'. So that we can speak normally, can unblock the diplomatic process," Zelensky said in a speech at the Chatham House think tank on Friday.
"I believe that not all bridges have yet been ruined," Zelensky said when upon being asked what minimum terms he could accept in a potential peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia.
When asked what he would define as victory, Zelensky said "Ukraine's victory is important" to him, but "we are speaking about saving our territory and saving as many people as possible."
