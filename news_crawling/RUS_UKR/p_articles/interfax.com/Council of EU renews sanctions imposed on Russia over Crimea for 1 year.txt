Sanctions include a ban on imports of goods from Crimea or Sevastopol to the EU, investments in Crimea or Sevastopol, and tourism services in Crimea or Sevastopol.
BRUSSELS. June 20 Interfax - The Council of the European Union has made a decision on Monday to extend restrictions imposed on the Russian Federation due to Crimea's accession to it for one more year, until June 23, 2023, the Council of the EU said in a statement released on Monday.
Exports of certain goods and technologies to Crimean companies or for use in Crimea in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors or for the prospection, exploration and production of oil, gas and mineral resources are also banned.
Brussels repeatedly said that the European Union "will never recognize and will continue condemning" Crimea's accession to Russia.
In June 2014, the Council of the EU imposed these restrictions as a response to "the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation." The measures apply to individuals from the EU and companies based in the EU. They are limited to the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol.
