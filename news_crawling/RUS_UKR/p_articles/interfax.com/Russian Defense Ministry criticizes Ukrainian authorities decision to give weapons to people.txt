"Unfortunately, the collective West, the United Nations, the OSCE, and other international organizations have not given any appropriate evaluations to these events until now," Mizintsev said.
"And the only thing the Kyiv regime has managed to do in this situation in a more or less organized way was to give all of the said radical groups small arms and munitions, without any control or restrictions," Mizintsev told a briefing on Friday.
MOSCOW. March 4 Interfax - The Ukrainian authorities' decision to give small arms to civilians works against their own people, Russian National Defense Control Center head Mikhail Mizintsev said.
"These weapons are now being used against their own people in the creation of defense lines made of 'living shields,' and also robbery and violence against civilians and foreign citizens," the general said.
