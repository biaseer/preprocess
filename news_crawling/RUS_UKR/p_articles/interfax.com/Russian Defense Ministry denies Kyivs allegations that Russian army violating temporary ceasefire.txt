MOSCOW. March 10 Interfax - The Russian side is observing a temporary ceasefire along all agreed humanitarian passages in Ukraine, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center Mikhail Mizintsev said.
"To yesterday's allegations by the Ukrainian authorities that the promised temporary ceasefire was allegedly not observed by the Russian Armed Forces, as well as the alleged blocking of motor transport convoys and humanitarian convoys in a number of settlements, we responsibly state that this is yet another mean lie and brazen provocation by the official Kyiv regime," the military official said.
"As of 10 a.m. local time today, in accordance with the agreements reached on the routes initiated by the Russian Federation and additional ones opened at the request of the Ukrainian side, the Russian Armed Forces have introduced a temporary ceasefire, which is being strictly observed," he said at a press briefing on Thursday.
