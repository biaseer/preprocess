MOSCOW. April 21 Interfax - Austria has fully abandoned purchasing Russian oil owing to Russia having launched its military operation against Ukraine, the Kurier publication reported, citing a representative from Austria's OMV Group.
The publication has quoted the OMV representative as saying that the volume of oil purchased from Russia had always been very low, and that it has been replaced with other oil from the market since the beginning of the military operation.
According to the country's Statistics Office and the Petroleum Industry Association, only 7.8, or 596,000 tonnes, of Austria's imported oil came from Russia in 2021.
Meantime, Kazakhstan has been the most important supplier of oil to Austria "for many years", having accounted for 38.9 of all imports. Libya is second at 22.1, and Iraq is third at 20.7.
