"We openly marked Russia's boundaries and zones of national interest, both economic and critically important strategic ones. First of all, these are our Arctic waters, the waters of the Black Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, the Baltic and Kuril straits," Putin said, speaking at the Main Naval Parade on Russia's Navy Day.
Putin said that Russia's borders have been marked, including in the Arctic and the Black Sea, in the new Maritime Doctrine. He emphasized that they will be protected resolutely and firmly, using all means.
"In order to ensure the implementation of the national maritime policy of the Russian Federation, I resolve to endorse the Maritime Doctrine of the Russian Federation as attached hereto," the decree says.
The ceremony of signing the decrees enacting the Maritime Doctrine of the Russian Federation and the Ship Charter of the Russian Navy was held inside the State Museum of St. Petersburg History in the Peter and Paul Fortress earlier on Sunday.
"This Decree takes effect on the day it is signed," the Kremlin press service said.
The Russian Navy's capabilities are the key factor in this regard, Putin said. "It is capable of responding at lightning speed to everyone who dares to encroach on our sovereignty and freedom. It is effectively, with dignity, accomplishing strategic missions on the borders of our country and in any area of the World Ocean. It has a high level of preparedness for active actions with regard to its coastal, surface, air and submarine forces and vehicles. They constantly undergo upgrades," he said.
MOSCOW. Aug 1 Interfax - Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the decree "On the Approval of the Maritime Doctrine of the Russian Federation," the Kremlin press service said on Sunday.
