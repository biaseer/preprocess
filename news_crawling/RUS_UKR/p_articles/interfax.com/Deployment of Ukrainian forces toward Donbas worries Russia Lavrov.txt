"It turns out that they are deploying additional forces, while those that are supposed to be replaced aren't going anywhere, either. That's disquieting. I believe that Western colleagues are perfectly aware of the situation, because Ukraine does nothing without notifying them or receiving support," Lavrov told reporters on Wednesday.
Lavrov said that will be one of the issues addressed at his meetings with Western colleagues on Thursday on the sidelines of the Stockholm meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Ministerial Council.
MOSCOW. Dec 1 Interfax - Ukrainian forces being deployed toward Donbas worries Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.
Russia has called the attention of Western partners to the fact that the Ukrainian leadership is actively sending trains full of troops and heavy weapons to the contact line, Lavrov said. Initially, "that was explained with the need for rotation of servicemen stationed in the area for some time," he said.
