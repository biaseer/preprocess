"Gazprom is supplying Russian gas for transit through Ukraine in the volume confirmed by the Ukrainian side through the Sudzhda GMS - 61.97 million cubic meters as of 13 May. The application for the Sohranivka GMS has been rejected," Gazprom's official spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov told reporters
As reported, the GTSOU declared a force majeure with respect to transit via the Sohranivka gas metering station, citing its inability to carry out operational and technological control of the Novopskov compressor station. Gazprom  believes that there are no grounds for force majeure and no obstacles to continuing operations as before.
