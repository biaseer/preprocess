MOSCOW: The Kremlin said Monday on the eve of talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Joe Biden that Moscow is not expecting "breakthroughs", as tensions rise over Ukraine.
Kiev and its Western allies accuse Moscow of sending arms and troops to support the rebels, who seized the territory in 2014 shortly after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
"It's difficult to expect breakthroughs from the talks," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russian news agencies.
Russia has denied the accusations and said it is concerned about what it says is a Ukrainian mobilisation totalling half its army near two regions in the country's east held by pro-Moscow separatists.
"Although our bilateral relations are still in a very sad state, there is still a revival, dialogue is beginning in some areas."
"Therefore let's at least hope that the leaders will be able to convey their concerns to each other," he said.
Washington and Kiev say Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders and could launch an invasion next month.
The two leaders are expected to discuss a range of issues on Tuesday in the evening Russia time by secure video link, after weeks of Washington accusing Moscow of planning an invasion of ex-Soviet Ukraine.
Ahead of Tuesday's talks, the White House said Biden will underscore Washington's concerns with Russian military activities on the border.
