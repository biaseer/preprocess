It also mentioned Russias desire to develop a safe and competitive sea route from Europe to Asia, known as the Northeast Passage, via the countrys Arctic coastline and ensure it worked throughout the year.
Todays Russia cannot exist without a strong fleet... and will defend its interests in the worlds oceans firmly and with resolution, the doctrine added.
SAINT PETERSBURG: The United States quest to dominate the oceans and NATOs expansion are the biggest threats facing Russia, according to a new Russian naval doctrine signed by President Vladimir Putin on Sunday.
The doctrine said Moscow will seek to strengthen its leading position in exploring the Arctic and its mineral resources and maintain strategic stability there by bolstering the potential of the northern and Pacific fleets.
Moscow views the Western military alliance  the Soviet Unions enemy during the Cold War  as an existential threat, using Ukraines membership hopes to justify its offensive on February 24.
The 55-page document said the main challenges and threats to national security and development were Washingtons strategic objective to dominate the worlds oceans and NATO military infrastructure moving towards Russias borders.
Russias independent internal and external policy faces counter-measures from the United States and its allies, who aim to preserve their dominance in the world, including its oceans, said the doctrine, signed on Russian Navy Day.
