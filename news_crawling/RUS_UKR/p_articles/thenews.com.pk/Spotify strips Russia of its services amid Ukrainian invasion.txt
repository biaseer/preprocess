After carefully considering our options and the current circumsta"nces, we have come to the difficult decision to fully suspend our service in Russia.
This news comes shortly after Spotify initially refused to halt all services earlier, in the name of global free flow of information.
Unfortunately, recently enacted legislation further restricting access to information, eliminating free expression, and criminalizing certain types of news puts the safety of Spotifys employees and possibly even our listeners at risk.
According to Variety, it reads, Spotify has continued to believe that its critically important to try to keep our service operational in Russia to provide trusted, independent news and information in the region.
The indefinite suspension has been announced by the streaming platform as part of an official statement.
