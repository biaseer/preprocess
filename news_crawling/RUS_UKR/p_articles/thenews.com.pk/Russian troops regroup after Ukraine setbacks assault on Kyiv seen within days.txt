Biden also moved Friday to end normal trade relations with Russia, further racheting up pressure on President Vladimir Putin after the bloody invasion of Ukraine.The United States, like other Western nations, is sending millions of dollars of weapons such anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, as well as sharing intelligence.But Biden again underlined that US forces would not fight in Ukraine, despite the desperate pleas of many Ukrainians.We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine. Direct confrontation between Nato and Russia is World War III  something we must strive to prevent, Biden said.The United States and our allies and partners continue in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressures on Putin and to further isolate Russia on the global stage, Biden said.

Russia is likely seeking to reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days, Britains Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update.

Ukraine said it would try yet again to mount an evacuation from the city: We hope it will work today, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden on Friday vowed that Russia would pay a severe price if it used chemical weapons in Ukraine, while also pledging to avoid provoking Moscow into World War III.Biden reacted after Russia accused Ukraine and the United States of developing biological and chemical weapons  in what Western nations says is a ruse to lay the ground for Moscows own possible use of them in the conflict.Im not going to speak about the intelligence, but Russia would play a severe price if they used chemicals, Biden said as he announced a raft of new sanctions against Moscow.

Russias main attack force that earlier formed a snaking line of some 60-km in northern Ukraine has been stalled on a highway north of Kyiv since the initial days of the invasion, having failed in what Western countries believe was an initial plan for a lightning assault on the capital.But images released by private US satellite firm Maxar showed armoured units manoeuvring in and through towns close to Antonov airport at Hostomel northwest of Kyiv, which has been the site of intense fighting since Russia landed paratroops there in the first hours of the war.Other elements had repositioned near the small settlement of Lubyanka just to the north, with towed artillery howitzers in firing positions, Maxar said.Russia is likely seeking to reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity in the coming days, Britains Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update.

LVIV: Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv are regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital, satellite pictures showed, and Britain said on Friday Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days.
