Normally, the retired gear is shipped around the country to help train prospective fire recruits, which some of the gear in this batch is going to a south suburb of Chicago for.
You can connect with the Oronoco Fire Department just like Excelsior did, by going to their Facebook page.
Chief Mackey told KARE 11 that helping out those in Ukraine is just as important as helping out neighboring cities in Minnesota.
The fire gear is being repurposed, as a lot of gear is every year, but this time helping out globally.
Around 15 packages of fire gear donated by the Excelsior Fire District were shipped off to Oronoco on Saturday, and will soon be hand-delivered to civilians in Ukraine who are looking to rebuild their cities and keep other civilians safe, according to District Chief Curt Mackey.
Other departments can donate used gear. The Oronoco Fire Department is taking donations every Monday evening from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. until April 11.
Lets give back in any way we can, whether that's repurposing equipment, meeting their medical needs, whatever we can do as a small organization, it builds in a collaborative effort to be extremely powerful, Chief Mackey said.
EXCELSIOR, Minn.  Much needed supplies are on their way to Ukraine, coming straight out of the Twin Cities.
The gear wont touch fire here in the United States since its been so used up and has fallen below code, but that doesnt mean those in Ukraine cant use it for their purposes.
