He said the US proposals for freezing the situation in Ukraine fell short of adressing the issue. "Other priorities are more important for us: non-expansion of NATO, elimination of the created infrastructure, refusal of measures, and not on a reciprocal basis, but on a unilateral basis from the West ".
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Riabkov arrived in Geneva for Russian-US negotiations on peace guarantees. He had dinner with his American counterparts before talks got underway.
Russia considers it unrealistic to wait for a solution in Geneva, but NATO must already start preparing to pull back.
