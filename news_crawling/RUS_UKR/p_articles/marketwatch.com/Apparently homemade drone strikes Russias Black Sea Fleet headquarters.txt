KYIV, Ukraine  A small explosive device carried by a makeshift drone blew up Sunday at the headquarters of Russias Black Sea Fleet on the Crimean Peninsula, wounding six people and prompting the cancellation of ceremonies there honoring Russias navy, authorities said.
Meanwhile, one of Ukraines richest men, a grain merchant, was killed in what Ukrainian authorities said was a carefully targeted Russian missile strike on his home.
