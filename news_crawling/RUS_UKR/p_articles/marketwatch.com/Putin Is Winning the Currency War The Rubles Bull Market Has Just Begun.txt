What that might mean for the global chessboard is a matter for another time and place.
The monthly closing chart below dates back to 1993. And it shows clearly that this advance is the most dramatic advance that the ruble has ever had since it began trading against the U.S. dollar.
So what do the charts say now? The monthly chart below from the 2008 high shows the rubles dramatic hurdling of a 13 12-year downtrend and every moving average in its initial sprint.
The war has been quite profitable for Putin. Europe continues to purchase Russian oil and natural gas. Meanwhile, Russia has been able to escape sanctions, finding buyers for its oil at a discount to the world price. Another source of income is the sale of stolen Ukrainian wheat.
Less than two weeks later, on March 7, the ruble declined to just 23 of a cent.Since then, it has almost tripled to 1.8 cents at Mondays closeits highest value versus the U.S. dollar since June 2015. I wrote that the ruble had bottomed and begun a bull market in the May 20 report of The Institutional View.

While the outcome of the fight for Ukraine is still in doubt, one thing is certain: Russian President Vladimir Putin is winning the currency war. For the past 29 years, the Russian ruble had been sinking in a dizzying spiral. From parity versus the U.S. dollar in 1993, it had become practically worthless, trading at 1 14 cents when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
My work projects that the ruble will surge another 60 by the end of 2023. This is the beginning of a multiyear bull market that will at least double current levelstaking the ruble back to its 2008 high. And there is even the possibility that it could climb all the way to 1998 levels, which would put it at 35 cents.
