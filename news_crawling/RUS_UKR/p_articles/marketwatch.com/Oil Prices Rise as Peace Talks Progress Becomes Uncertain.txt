Oil prices rose early Wednesday for the first time in three days as the positivity around progress in Ukraine and Russia peace talks was replaced by uncertainty and skepticism.
Russia had promised to scale down operations in regions that reports say came under further attack overnight. This caused markets to question progress made in peace talks that helped oil prices fall and stocks rally Tuesday.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that Russia has started moving troops away from areas around Kyiv but warned it does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over, according to reports.
OPEC, the group of major oil producers, will meet Thursday to decide on output levels from May. The group chose not to increase output in April despite oil prices pushing above $110 a barrel at the time.
West Texas Intermediate futures climbed 2 to $106.31 a barrel, after falling 8.5 in the previous two days from Fridays $113.90 settlement price. Brent crude futures  the global benchmark  climbed close to 2 to $109.65 a barrel, after a similar two-day fall. The slump came as Chinas most populous city, Shanghai, imposed lockdown measures, triggering fears over weakened demand.
The losses were extended Tuesday as positive signs emerged from peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul, Turkey. Russias chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said the talks were constructive, while the countrys deputy defense minister promised to scale down operations in Kyiv and northern Ukraine.
