A cyberattack hit the websites of Ukrainian government agencies and major banks Tuesday, Ukrainian authorities said.
The attack, the latest of several hacking operations targeting Ukraine, came after weeks of escalating fears that Russia might invade its neighboring country. Russia sent signals Tuesday that it might be pulling back from the brink of an invasion, but Western powers demanded proof.
