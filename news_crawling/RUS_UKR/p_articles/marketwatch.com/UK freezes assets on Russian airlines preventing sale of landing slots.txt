The latest sanctions over Russias war in Ukraine stop state-owned Aeroflot RU:AFLT, Russias biggest carrier, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines  from transferring the valuable landing rights, which are going unused because of an earlier ban on Russian aircraft flying to the United Kingdom.
Britain on Thursday froze the assets of three Russian airlines, preventing them from selling landing slots at U.K. airports that are worth up to 50 million pounds $62 million.
