Marina Ovsyannikova was charged over her role in a street protest last month, when she held up a banner reading, Russian President Vladimir Putin is a killer, his soldiers are fascists. 352 children have been killed in Ukraine. How many more children should die for you to stop?
A court in Russia late last week ordered a former state TV journalist placed under house arrest for nearly two months pending an investigation and potential trial on charges of spreading false information about Russias armed forces.
