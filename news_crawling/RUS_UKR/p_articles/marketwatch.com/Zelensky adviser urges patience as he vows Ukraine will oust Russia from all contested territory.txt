KYIV, Ukraine  A Ukrainian presidential adviser has vowed that Kyiv will retake all the lands currently under Russian control and urged Ukrainians to be patient.
Dont let the news that weve ceded something scare you, Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video address on Tuesday. It is clear that tactical maneuvers are ongoing. We cede something, we take something back. Russians, he said, outnumber Ukrainian troops and have more equipment.
