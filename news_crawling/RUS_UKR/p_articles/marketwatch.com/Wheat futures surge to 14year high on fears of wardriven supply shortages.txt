Wheat futures for May delivery W00 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange surged to $10.28 a bushel, the highest since 2014, according to analysts at Commerzbank, who noted it rose by its expanded 75 cent-limit, having climbed by its 50-cent limit on Tuesday.
The price of a bushel of wheat surged to levels not seen in more than a decade on Wednesday as investor anxiety surrounding potential supply shortages from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine stretched to its seventh day.
