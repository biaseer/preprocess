President Joe Biden on Thursday made an effort to walk back a much-criticized comment that he made the prior day about Russian President Vladimir Putin potentially launching a "minor incursion" targeting Ukraine. "If any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion," Biden said Thursday ahead of a meeting on infrastructure. "If Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price." During a news conference on Wednesday, Biden made a comment that could be interpreted as giving Putin permission to make a minor incursion into Ukraine.
