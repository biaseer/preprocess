Natural gas prices in Europe surged on Monday to their most expensive since the early stages of Russias invasion of Ukraine as proposed strikes in Norway increased fears about inadequate supply.
Natural gas on the Dutch-based TTF trading hub at one point rose more than 10 to change hands above 160 euros a megawatt-hour for August futures. A year ago the product traded for 22.4 euros.
