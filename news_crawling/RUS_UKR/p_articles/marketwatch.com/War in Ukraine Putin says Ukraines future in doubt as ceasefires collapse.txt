Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Saturday that Ukrainian statehood is in jeopardy and likened the Wests sanctions on Russia to declaring war, while a promised cease-fire in the port city of Mariupol collapsed amid scenes of terror in the besieged town.
With the Kremlins rhetoric growing fiercer and a reprieve from fighting dissolving, Russian troops continued to shell encircled cities and the number of Ukrainians forced from their country grew to 1.4 million.
