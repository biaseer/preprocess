We were firm  in pushing back on security proposals that are simply non-starters to the United States, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told in a separate telephone briefing after nearly eight hours of talks with Ryabkov. Nonetheless, the US diplomat pointed to the possibility of mutual compromises, saying Washington was open to discussing missile deployments in Europe as well as setting limits on the size and scope of military exercises, Reuters reports.
Unfortunately, we have a great disparity in our principled approaches to this. The U.S. and Russia in some ways have opposite views on what needs to be done, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov noted to journalists after the talks. Ryabkov reiterated a set of wild demands, among them a ban on further NATO expansion and an end to the activity of the military alliance in the central and eastern European countries that joined after 1997.
Russia has repeated its demands over Ukraine in long talks in Switzerland with the US, but Washington has signalled they cannot be discussed, British-Canadian news agency Reuters reports.
