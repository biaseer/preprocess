If Russia continues committing crimes like Bucha massacre in Ukraine, Moscow will have to expect complete isolation, stressed Zelenskyy.
Our participation depends on the Russian Federation, depending on whether they come as well, announced Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday, 3 July.
Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin making his intention to participate in the summit clear, it is unclear if he intends to appear in person or virtually.
I told the Indonesian president that we are grateful but in a difficult security situation, said Zelenksyy, adding that he doubts the participation of many countries if Russia decides to participate.

Indonesias President Joko Widodo invited Ukraine to participate in the G20 summit during his last weeks visit to Kyiv.
Ukraines participation in G20 summit, which is scheduled to take place in Indonesia, will depend on the military situation and whether Russia participates in it as well.
