Thousands of people were at the train station when the missiles hit. These people were preparing to evacuate, because an attack of Russian forces is imminent in Donbas.
On Friday, 8 April, Russian armed forces in Ukraine attacked a train station in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast with missiles. Dozens of people killed, as reported by Governor of Donetsk Oblast Pavlo Kirilenko.
Those who fired the missiles knew very well where they were aiming and what they wanted. They want to sow panic and fear, Kirilenko stressed in his statement.
