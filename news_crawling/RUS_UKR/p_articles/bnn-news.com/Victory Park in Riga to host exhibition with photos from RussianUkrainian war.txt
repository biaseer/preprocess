He stressed that the entire world commemorates the people who died in WWII on 8 May and laying flowers does not require a permit.
He said 9 May event cannot happen in Riga while the war rages in Ukraine. And I am rather sceptical about any major event, unless its not a support event, stressed the politician.
As previously reported, Stais has invited Rigas CEO to not issue permits for events near the monument to Soviet troops in Riga on 9 May. He said this in an interview to LTV programme De facto.
Commenting if a concert in support of Ukraine could be organized in Victory Park on 9 May, Stais said we have better places for concerts.
His personal opinion is that such an event should not happen and there is no place for it in Riga and Latvia.

A special exhibition will be hosted in Victory Park in cooperation with photographer Ilmrs Znoti, who selected high definition photos from different news agencies depicting Ukraines grey everyday life during this war.
This is all symbolic from the viewpoint that Victory Park was established as victory square after our Latvia Freedom Fights, where Latvia proved to the world that a small but motivated army with a great desire for independence is able to win against overwhelming odds, said the mayor of Riga.
An exhibition featuring photos from the war in Ukraine will be organised in the Victory Park in Riga, said Rigas Mayor Mrti Stais in an interview to TV3 programme 900 seconds on 22 March.
He proposed organisers of the event to not come to the municipal administration to apply for the event. Even if the municipality fails to prohibit it, no selling, catering, audio equipment or fireworks will be allowed there.
