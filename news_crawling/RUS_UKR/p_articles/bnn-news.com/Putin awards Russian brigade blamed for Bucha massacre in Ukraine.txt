In Russia, a military unit blamed by Ukraine of killing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha during its occupation has received an honorary title from the Russian President, American broadcaster Radio Free Europe reports.
Most of the civilians killed in Bucha died from gunshot wounds, Ukrainian police stated earlier in April as some of the victims had their hands tied behind their back. The Russian government has denied organising mass killings or genocide in Ukraine, Radio Free Europe wrote. BBC reports that more than 500 people have been found killed in Bucha.
A decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on April 18 gave the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces the title of Guards for their defense of the motherland and state interests and praised the mass heroism and valor, tenacity, and courage of its members.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry argued that the unit committed war crimes during its occupation of Bucha, a town northwest of Kyiv, and has vowed to seek justice for the victims.
