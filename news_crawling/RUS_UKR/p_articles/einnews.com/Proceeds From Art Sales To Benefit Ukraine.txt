SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, UNITED STATES, April 29, 2022EINPresswire.com -- Helen Lavelle, award winning artist and Creative Strategist at the advertising agency that bears her name, will be a featured artist in May at POSH  The Scranton Club. Lavelle's exhibit of more than a dozen paintings will debut at First Friday Scranton on Friday, May 6.
A nationally-recognized leader in the advertising industry, Lavelle is also an advocate for the arts in all genres. Her figurative, landscape and abstract work is held in corporate and private collections worldwide.
A portion of the proceeds of art print sales during the exhibit will be donated to St. Vladimir Ukrainian Catholic Church to benefit all people suffering during the war in Ukraine. Every artist has an opportunity to give back in a way that not a lot of people do. This is my way of doing that, states Ms. Lavelle.
