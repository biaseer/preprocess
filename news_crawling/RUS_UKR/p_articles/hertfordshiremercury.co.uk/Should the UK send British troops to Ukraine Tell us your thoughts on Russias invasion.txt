The world will hold Russia accountable  for its unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, says Americas leader, President Joe Biden who is said to be monitoring the situation from Washington, DC, and continues to get regular updates from his national security team.
There are other ways of aiding the European ally and they have been training Ukrainian forces for years.
Russia's aggression towards Ukraine has caused the price of oil close to $100 per barrel, but the UK is not as dependent as other European countries on Russian gas.
Boris Johnson has announced that extra military support including lethal aid will be sent to Ukraine in light of the increasingly threatening behaviour from Russia after Putin sent troops into the Donbas region earlier this week.
Direct involvement has been ruled out by Western leaders, but Johnson has told the people of the Ukraine that the UK would stand with them in a crisis that could go on for many months.
The PM wants to diminish this dependence entirely and collectively cease dependence on Russian oil and gas he said in a speech.
Johnson has already declared a massive package of economic sanctions on Russia for its action in Ukraine.
Several parts of Ukraine including cities Kyiv and Kharkiv have been shelled and in a televised speech Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK cannot and will not look away as Putin has unleashed war on our European continent.
Ukraine has deep social and cultural ties with Russia, as a former Soviet republic and Russian is a common language there, but Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to fight for the country's freedom saying: "We're strong. We're ready for anything."
Over the last 7 years, Ukraine has moved towards European institutions, namely the EU and defence alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organisation NATO, after Russia seized part of Ukraines territory when its pro-Russian president was overthrown in early 2014.
The Prime Minister also declared in a statement on Twitter that Russia has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction.
He continued: If the oil price were to increase to 110 US dollars per barrel theres a very real danger the average price of petrol would hit 1.55 a litre.
Ukraine is not part of the NATO so the British government has been clear in its response that they will not involve British combat forces.
