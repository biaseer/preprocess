The Icelandic broadcaster has announced the seven jury members that will help to determine the Icelandic representative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2022. The jurors will vote in the first round of the show and combined with the Icelandic public will help to select two acts to go through to the Super Final.
Iceland debuted in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1986 and, aside from 2 years of relegation in 1998 and 2002, has participated every year since. The contest is incredibly popular in Iceland, regularly being one of the most-watched programs of the year. Iceland has yet to win the contest but has finished in 2nd on two occasions. In 1999, Selma missed out on victory in Jerusalem by 17 points, and in 2009 Yohanna became the most successful Icelandic entrant ever finishing 2nd in the final with the song Is it True?. She scored 218 points, yet still finished 169 points behind the runaway winner Norway.
The jurors who will determine 50 of the result in the first round of the Sngvakeppnin 2022 final have been announced.
