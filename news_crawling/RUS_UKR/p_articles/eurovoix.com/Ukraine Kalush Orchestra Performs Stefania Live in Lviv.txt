I have been following the Eurovision Song Contest since 2006, and more recently I've enjoyed watching partner contests such as the Junior Eurovision Song Contest and Eurovision Young Dancers. I joined Eurovoix as an editor at the beginning of 2017.
Kalush is a rap group formed in 2019, consisting of Oleh Psiuk rapper, Ihor Didenchuk multi-instrumentalist, and MC Kilimmen DJ. Ihor is also a member of GoA, who represented Ukraine at the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest. This year, Kalush launched the Kalush Orchestra, which focuses on rap and folk fusion music. Tymofii Muzychuk and Vitalii Duzhyk joined the core Kalush members for this project.
Ukrainian Eurovision representatives, Kalush Orchestra, has performed Stefania in Lviv, Ukraine, as part of their promotional concert tour. The group is planning to raise funds to aid the reconstruction of Ukrainian cities affected by the war.
The band met in Lviv together for the first time since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and are now actively working on their performance. Yesterday it was revealed that Kalush Orchestra will perform live at the Eurovision Song Contest, after fears that they would not be able to attend due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Ukraine first participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003, when Oleksandr Ponomariov performed Hasta la vista. The following year Ruslana brought the country their first win with the song Wild Dances. It was a feat that would be replicated in 2016 by Jamala with her song 1944 her emotionally charged song scored a record 534 points to take victory in Stockholm. In 2017 O.Torvald represented the country on home soil with the song Time. The group finished in 24th place, Ukraines worst result at the contest to date. Ukraine is the last remaining country with a 100 semi-final qualification record.
