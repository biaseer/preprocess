In a report last month, Unicef had said 3 million children insideUkraineand over 2.2 million children in refugee-hosting countries are now in need of humanitarian assistance.
Children fleeing violence are at significant risk of family separation, violence, abuse, sexual exploitation, and trafficking.
The Office, however, said that the figures were "not final, as work continues to establish the data in places of active hostilities and in the temporarily occupied and liberated territories".
In its latest update on Thursday, the Office of the Prosecutor General said 645 children have also been injured, reports Ukrayinska Pravda.
Almost two out of every three children have been displaced by fighting, according to the UN agency.
Since Russia began its ongoing invasion of Kiev on February 24, at least 346 children have been killed in Ukraine.
Due to the relentless bombing and shelling by the Russian forces, 2,108 educational institutions in Ukraine have been damaged, of which 215 are completely destroyed.
