Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last week, said the crisis was fuelled by US policies and that Iran supports ending the war in the Eastern European country.
The war has drawn international condemnation, and led to severe financial sanctions on Moscow. A growing number of multinationals have also fully or partially halted business in Russia.
Over 2.1 million Ukrainians have also fled to neighbouring countries, the UN Refugee Agency said.
Iran has opposed the war and called for a peaceful settlement, but has also blamed the simmering crisis on what it calls "US-led NATO's expansionism".
Moscow refers to its war that began on 24 February as a "special military operation" meant to "denazify" and "demilitarise" Ukraine.
At least 516 civilians have been killed and 908 others injured in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to UN figures.
