Israeli defence officials rejected Ukraine's efforts to obtain the Israeli Pegasus programme due to fears of jeopardising its relations with Russia.
Additional sources close to the matter said Israel's decision reflected a reluctance to agitate Russia, which has a close intelligence relationship with Israel. The sources said Israel feared that granting Ukraine the ability to target Russia-based mobile phone numbers through Pegasus would be viewed as an act of aggression against Russian intelligence services.
NSO is an Israeli company specialising in the development of cyber-espionage tools. It was founded in 2010.
However, NSO software was made infamous in July when the University of Toronto's internet watchdog, Citizen Lab, exposed numerous governments' misuse of the software through the hacking of around 50,000 phones and devices belonging to journalists, human rights activists and political critics worldwide.
