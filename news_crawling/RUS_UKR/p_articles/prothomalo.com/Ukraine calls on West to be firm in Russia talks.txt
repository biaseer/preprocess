Britain is set to double the NATO force with troops, weapons, warships and jets, Prime minister Boris Johnson said Saturday, as Washington warned the Kremlin had massed enough troops and hardware at the border to threaten the whole of Ukraine.
As top US defence officials have called for further diplomatic efforts to avert a horrific conflict, Western leaders have scrambled to defuse the crisis by reaching out to Russian president Vladimir Putin, while also trying to keep the pressure up by vowing unprecedented sanctions should he send in his forces.
Kyiv on Saturday urged the West to remain vigilant and firm in its talks with Russia, as US president Joe Biden announced a small troop deployment to eastern Europe amid fears Moscow could order the invasion of Ukraine.
