The western sanctions on Russia and the war there are having a negative impact on the supply of other items to Bangladesh, not only wheat.
After the onset of the war there, the price of rods has gone up by Tk 5,000 per tonne.
Bangladesh is set to be affected as the country imports a large quantity of wheat from Russia and Ukraine.
Wheat prices are spiralling in the international market as with the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, wheat import from both these sources has become uncertain.
Businesspersons in the steel sector are concerned too. Ukraine is a major source of scrap iron used as raw material for steel rods.
