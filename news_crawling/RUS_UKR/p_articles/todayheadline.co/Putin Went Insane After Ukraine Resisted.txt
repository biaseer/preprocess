Khodorkovsky  who was once the richest man in Russia, and was imprisoned for nine years on charges of fraud and tax evasion until his release in 2013  has been an outspoken critic of Putin. He has said his imprisonment was politically motivated.
An exiled Russian oligarch said Putin went insane after he anticipated that the people of Ukraine would meet him with flowers when he invaded the country.
Khodorkovsky said Putin has three ways out of this crisis: continue to pressure Ukraine, use weapons of mass destruction to force Ukrainians to retreat, or start actual negotiations.
At first, what he wanted was to change the power in Kyiv, put in his puppet, and was expecting that this would be met with flowers thrown in the streets by Ukrainian people, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former CEO of the Russian oil giant Yukos, told CNNs Fareed Zakaria on Sunday.
Im convinced that Putin hasnt got much time left. Maybe a year, maybe three,he told CNN.
On Saturday, former Russian Deputy Energy minister Vladimir Milov told CNNs Erin Burnett top officials in the Russian government are personally devastated by Putins aggression in Ukraine, adding it was only a matter of months before Putin lost his grasp on power.
The fact that the people in Kharkiv did not meet him with flowers, it not only just angered him, I really think it drove him literally insane. Thats when he started bombing Kharkiv and Kyiv, Khodorkovsky said.
Last month the exiled oligarch said the war in Ukraine would lead to Putins downfall.
