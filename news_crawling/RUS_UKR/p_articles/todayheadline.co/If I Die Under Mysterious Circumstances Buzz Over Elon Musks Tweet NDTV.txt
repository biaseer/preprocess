Mr Musk has been consistently making headlines over the past few months during which he criticised Twitter over the shrinking space for free speech, then opted out of joining its board at the last moment and then announcing its decision to buy it for the whopping sum.
In February, Mr Musks company SpaceXs Starlink satellite broadband service was activated in Ukraine after a minister from the war-hit country reached out.
The two posts sparked speculation on whether the Tesla CEO is facing threats from Russia for helping Ukraine amid the war.
The communication also claimed that the equipment was delivered in Ukraine by the Pentagon, headquarters of the US Department of Defense.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known to stir up a storm with his tweets, sparked another buzz today in a post talking about death under mysterious circumstances.
Following the announcement, he has teased radical ideas for the micro-blogging site, including introducing a fee for commercial and government users.
Shortly before this, Mr Musk shared a post that appears to be a communication saying he is involved in supplying the fascist forces in Ukraine with military communication equipment. And for this, Elon, you will be held accountable like an adult  no matter how much youll play the fool, the post adds.
Some users asked if Mr Musk was intoxicated, others concluded that it is the huge taxes that is bothering him and some said he needs to live to bring about reform.
If I die under mysterious circumstances, its been nice knowin ya, tweeted Mr Musk, about a week after he announced his decision to buy micro-blogging site Twitter for $44 Billion.
The tweet on death under mysterious circumstances met with varied responses, ranging from jokes to caution to solidarity.
