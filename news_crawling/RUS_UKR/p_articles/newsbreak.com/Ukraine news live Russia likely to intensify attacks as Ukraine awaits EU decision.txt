The British defence ministry said both Russia and Ukraine were committed to intense combat in the eastern  Donbas  region and were likely experiencing variable morale.
President Zelensky has said that he expects  Russia  to intensify its attacks on his country while it awaits a European Union decision this week on granting  Ukraine  the status of a candidate country.
Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks, however, Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled, the UK defence ministry said on Sunday morning.
Mr Zelenskys message comes after the news that whole Russian units are still refusing orders and engaging in armed stand-offs with officers.
And not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready.
Obviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities, as an example, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address.
It added low Russian morale was likely driven by factors including perceived poor leadership, very heavy casualties and problems with pay.
