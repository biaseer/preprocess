To end the war, we need new institutions and new alliances. We propose to create a new alliance, which will provide all the necessary support within 24 hours. Such alliances will provide help to those who will fall prey to various crises, and will help save thousands of lives, the president had said.
The meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to take place in the coming weeks, Ukraine Presidents advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Thursday. Russia and Ukraine are reportedly drafting a tentative peace plan to end the war. The Kyiv Independent reports that the deal includes a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops if Kiev renounces its ambitions to join NATO and accepts certain limitations on its armed forces. Once the peace treaty is finalized, Putin and Zelenskyy could meet.
After a technical pause, the fourth-round talks between Russia and Ukraine resumed via video link on March 15, Tuesday. According to Mykhailo Podoliyak, the brief pause was taken to clarify individual definitions in the working groups.
According to reports, the 4th round of negotiations focused on peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops, and security guarantees. As part of the negotiation process, Zelenskyy has proposed a direct meeting with his Russian counterpart.
The Presidents Office had previously stated that a new international security coalition would end the war with Russia in Ukraine. It is notable that Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue of a multinational security coalition in his address to the U.S. Congress on March 16.
