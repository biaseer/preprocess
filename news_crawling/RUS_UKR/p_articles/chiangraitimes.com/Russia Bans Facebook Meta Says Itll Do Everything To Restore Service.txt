The Russian government blocked Facebook on Friday amid the escalating war, international reports said. Russian-speaking citizens in Moscow were unable to access Facebook, Meduza, Deutsche Welle, RFE-RL, and the BBCs Russian-language website. An NGO monitoring the situation also said the sites were partially down. Independent online newspaper Meduza informed on its Telegram account that some of its users in Russia are no longer able to access the site.
In response to the blocking of Facebook throughout the country, Meta said it will do everything to restore service. Nick Clegg, Metas president of global affairs, said the company would work to restore its service and provide reliable information across Russia despite the ban. The Russians are also being blocked from connecting and speaking out, he said.
As the Ukraine invasion has progressed, Russia has tightened its grip on independent media, shutting down its top independent radio station. During the countrys invasion of Ukraine, an independent TV station also suspended operations. In addition to blocking Facebook in Russia, reports claimed that Twitter was also blocked. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation punishing any publication or release of information that contradicts official statements relating to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Russian authorities made Facebook and multiple other media websites inaccessible on Friday in an effort to stifle critical voices amid the Russia-Ukraine war. In response, Facebooks parent company Meta said it would do everything it can to restore service across Russia. The social media site wont be accessible to millions of Russians, Meta said in a statement.
