YOU are the smart one, Erin. Dont forget that. And dont forget, you are not alone.
How so many good-hearted Wyoming voters can support such a despicable, mean-spirted, hateful person, who now brags about his endearing bonds with Putin while Russia rapes and murder Ukrainians, is one of the great contradictions of our day.
And knowing there are so many sensible, caring Wyoming folks who support this person and look the other way at his incessant ridicule and denigration of others is particularly disturbing. As you said, Erin, these supporters betray themselves and all they supposedly stand for.
I write to thank Erin Madson for her courageous letter of April 20 calling-out ex-President Trump for his belittling of a disabled reporter during a press conference early in his term. For all those living with disabilities like Erin, I cannot possibly imagine how disturbing that was.
