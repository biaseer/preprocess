Russian and Ukrainian leaders held cease-fire negotiations on Monday, Feb. 28, but they ended with no breakthrough to end the fighting. A second round of talks Thursday, March 3, ended with an agreement to hold a third round "very soon."
The head of Russia's delegation said the countries had agreed to establish humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians and agreed on the "possibility" of a temporary ceasefire during humanitarian operations.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, an estimated 1 million have fled to neighboring E.U. states, according to the United Nations. Tens of thousands have also enlisted in the military in the week since Russia's invasion began. Ukraine's defense ministry reported Thursday, March 3, that they'd get help from roughly 16,000 military volunteers, too.
U.S. officials had said for weeks that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, a warning that Russia, in turn, dismissed as scaremongering. U.S. President Joe Biden warned of a "catastrophic loss of life and human suffering."
The U.S. has joined international partners in levying heavy new sanctions against Russia's military and economy in the days since the invasion began. President Biden has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country would bear the costs of the attack.
The wide-scale incursion began on Thursday, Feb. 24. Ukraine's military has claimed that Russia has faced steep casualties as a result of fierce fighting the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged Wednesday, March 2, that 498 Russian troops had been killed and another 1,597 injured in the "special military operation."
