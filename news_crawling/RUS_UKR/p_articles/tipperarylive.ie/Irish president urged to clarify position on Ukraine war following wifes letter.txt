Her views are entirely out of touch with those of the Irish people and interventions like this are seen as a tacit endorsement of the Russian regime.
Fianna Fail senator Malcolm Byrne said the letter was subsequently published on the President of Irelands official website  a move he described as appalling.
Mrs Higgins is entitled to her personal opinion and to express it, although I believe that she is totally wrong to try to see an equivalence in the positions of Ukraine and Russia, said Mr Byrne.
It is incumbent on the President of Ireland to now express clearly the strong support of the people of Ireland for the people of Ukraine and that we hold Russia responsible for the war and ongoing barbarism.
Mrs Higgins letter, the purpose of which was to criticise a previous editorial on the conflict, said the fighting would go on until the world persuades President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire and negotiations.
Irelands president has been urged to make a statement on the war in the Ukraine after his wife penned a controversial letter on the conflict.
While Sabina Higgins is entitled to her personal view, as expressed to IrishTimes , I completely disagree with it.
It comes after Sabina Higgins wrote a letter to the Irish Times during the week about the war.
Critics of the letter have suggested Mrs Higgins was drawing an equivalence in the actions of Ukraine and Russia.
Ireland strongly supports the people of Ukraine . We must continue to call out Russian aggression.
Michael D Higgins has faced calls to state support for the Ukrainian cause and voice opposition to Russian aggression.
