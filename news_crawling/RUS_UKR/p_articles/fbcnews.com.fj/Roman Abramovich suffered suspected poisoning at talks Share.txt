The Chelsea FC owner  who has now recovered  reportedly suffered sore eyes and peeling skin.
Shortly after the allegations emerged, an unnamed US official was quoted by Reuters as saying that intelligence suggested the mens symptoms were due to environmental factors, not poisoning.
However, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says it would hardly be surprising that the US would want to dampen down suggestions that anyone  especially Russia  had used a chemical weapon in Ukraine, as this could push them into retaliatory action that they are extremely reluctant to take.
One report said the alleged poisoning was orchestrated by hardliners in Russia who wanted to sabotage talks.
And later an official in the Ukrainian presidents office, Ihor Zhovkva, told the BBC that while he hadnt spoken to Mr Abramovich, members of the Ukrainian delegation were fine and one had said the story was false.
Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning at peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border earlier this month, sources close to him say.
