On Tuesday Russias Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said his country would radically, by several times reduce the military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions.
Russia said on Tuesday it would cut back operations around Chernihiv and the capital, Kyiv, in an effort to boost mutual trust in peace talks.
The UNs Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, meanwhile, said Russias allegedly indiscriminate attacks on populated areas of Ukraine may amount to war crimes.
There has been no let-up in attacks on Ukraines northern cities despite Russias pledge to reduce military action, regional authorities say.
But the Chernihiv regions governor told the BBC attacks had in fact continued overnight into Wednesday.
Addressing the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday, she said there were credible allegations that Russia had used cluster munitions in populated areas on multiple occasions. Such weapons are widely banned by an international treaty, but neither Russia nor Ukraine are signed up to it.
Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, a spokesperson for Ukraines armed forces, said that though there had been a partial movement of troops from the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv, they had yet to fully abandon attempts to seize, or at least surround these cities.
Her office has also verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities had been damaged  including 50 hospitals.
