As Russian troops entered Ukraine, the government in Kiev ordered the emergency destruction of pathogens including plague and anthrax at US-funded laboratories near the Russian border, the Ministry of Defense in Moscow claimed on Sunday.
Earlier rumors that the Russian military was targeting US-run biolabs were written off as conspiracy theories, but the ministry has promised to back up its claims with documents. We have received documentation from employees of Ukrainian biolaboratories on the emergency destruction on February 24 of especially dangerous pathogens of plague, anthrax, tularemia, cholera and other deadly diseases, read a statement from the ministry. As per news report of Rt.com, the statement accused the Kiev regime of conducting an emergency cleansing to hide evidence of the supposed biological weapons program, which the ministry claimed was funded by the US, and involved the production of biological weapons components at at least two laboratories in the cities of Poltava and Kharkov, both of which have seen intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in recent days.
