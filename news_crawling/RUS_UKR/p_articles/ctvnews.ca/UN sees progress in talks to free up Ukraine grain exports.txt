Before the talks, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told The Associated Press that grain exports from his country's ports would not resume without security guarantees to ship owners, cargo owners, and to keep Ukraine as an independent nation.
But Ukrainian officials have blamed a Russian naval blockade for holding up the exports and causing the global food crisis. They are skeptical of Putin's pledge not to take advantage of cleared Black Sea corridors to mount attacks on Ukrainian ports, noting that he insisted repeatedly this year that he had no plans to invade Ukraine.
He said the UN, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey will work together to ensure that an agreement is implemented effectively.
