On Tuesday, Wall Street Journal reporter Matthew Luxmoore picked up on footage from outside Melitopol, a southeastern Ukrainian city the Russians claim to have subjugated amid disputed reports. The clip shows Russian troops firing into the air while, according to Luxmoores translation, a crowd of civilians shouting at them, calling them occupants and murderers.
The video goes on to show a large Russian truck driving up and honking its horn at the crowd. The crowd doesnt back down, however, and they continued their chants while several people tried to push the vehicle backward.
