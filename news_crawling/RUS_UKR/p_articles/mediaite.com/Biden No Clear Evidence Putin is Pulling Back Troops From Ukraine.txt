Im a skeptic.But I dont have proof that infact he is not going  hestaking a pause doing all he canto use all the troops he has inthe Donbas and continue to keepan eye on and try to move beyondthe rest of the country.Dont know the answer, but itappears so far that he has notpulled all  idea hes pullingall the troops from around Kyivand moving south, theres noevidence that hes done that.
Thus far there is no clear evidence that hes pulling allof his forces out Ukraine.There is also evidence that heis beefing up his troops down inthe Donbas area.Depending on your view of Putin,Im a little skeptical.Its an open question whetherhes actually pulling back andgoing to say Im just going tofocus on the Donbas in Eastern Ukraine and notworried about the rest of thecountry.
