Putin has said Russia would stop its invasion of Ukraine in a moment if the latter agrees to terms that include changing its constitution, recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, and recognizing the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region as independent states.
Russia invaded Ukraine a week and a half ago and has been met with fierce resistance. The pretexts for Russias invasion the alleged need for peacekeeping missions in the Donbas region and the denazification of Ukraines government, which is led by Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish.
He added, We are winning the war and we are not going to surrender in any way.
A member of Ukraines parliament appeared on Newsmax on Monday to respond to Russian President Vladimir Putins demands.
I want to say some bad words, Goncharenko replied. Blank you, Putin, you know? I dont know how to say this isnot to offend your viewers. I just want to say to Putin what our soldiers told to his Russian military ship. Im sorry, go fuck yourself with all this.
In half a year he will start another war and say, I want another part of Ukraine, then another part of Ukraine. We will never accept this. This is our territory. Crimea is Ukraine. Donbas is Ukraine, and hes the aggressor, and he cannot demand from us anything.
Goncharenko said Putins offer is in bad faith and is part of a plan to gradually subsume Ukraine into Russia.
