NADWORNY: She's got a no-nonsense air and a sarcastic sense of humor. When I ask her if the building is tight-knit, she laughs.
NADWORNY: She jokes that she knows more about this damn war than anyone. Beyond her lace curtains, the windows are taped over so they won't break in a blast.

NADWORNY: As she outlines the recipe - shred the cabbage, add the sugar, then the salt - Oksana starts to play music again.
In an adjacent building across the courtyard with the empty swings and slide, we take a rickety elevator to the ninth floor.
NADWORNY: Whenever they hear explosions, she tells her son to go down to the shelter.
NADWORNY: "Even though my life isn't great," she says, "I don't want to die." But staying behind has had its challenges.
NADWORNY: Her great-grandmother gifted her the toy. And she's learning to teach herself to sing.
NADWORNY: She prays that the war will end soon so she'll be able to enjoy the rest of her days.
Most of the apartments in this building are still empty. But there's a handful, like Tamara and Pavlo's, that are filled with life because not everyone can evacuate. Often, the ones left behind are elderly.
NADWORNY: Pavlo was a pilot in the military for 25 years. He feels guilt now. He's too old to be of use.

NADWORNY: Her great-granddaughter Oksana, who is 11, is here visiting, playing music on a brightly colored plastic piano.

NADWORNY: But he tells her, I'm not going anywhere without you. We will be together. Maybe if she hadn't fallen down or been so ill, they would've left Kyiv. But it's too hard now.
Here in this apartment, the last several weeks, they've heard the explosions. The closest metro stop, a short walk away, was hit by missile fragments, the entrance burned and damaged.
NADWORNY: When she cries, Pavlo tells me, he comforts her. Yes, there is still danger outside, the air raid sirens, the unknown strike of a missile. "But we've made it this far in life," they tell me.
More people are fleeing Eastern Ukraine under the threat of intensified Russian assaults. In the north central part of the country, the capital, Kyiv, saw heavy fighting at the beginning of the war. Hundreds of thousands fled, and now the city remains largely empty. But in apartment buildings throughout the city, you still find people who stayed behind. NPR's Elissa Nadworny reports from Kyiv.

NADWORNY: "Come in, come in," he says, and leads us to the living room. They sit side by side on the floral couch. They're both 87 years old.
NADWORNY: She unwraps an old, blue photo album. She'd protected them in case she had to leave in a hurry or her apartment was damaged.
NADWORNY: "This is what I wanted to show you," she says, leafing through the pages.
They met as children. Their parents were doctors at a local hospital. They lived together nearly their whole lives.
NADWORNY: As kids, they fled to what's now Russia during the Second World War. It's hard to believe a place they sought refuge could do this to them.
NADWORNY: Her first child was born here in 1969. She became an engineer here, her job before she stopped working.
