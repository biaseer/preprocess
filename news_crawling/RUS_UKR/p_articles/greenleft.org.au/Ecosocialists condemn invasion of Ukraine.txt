Modern war and modern war machines run overwhelmingly on fossil fuels. They are major carbon emitters and catastrophic in terms of their impact on the environment as a whole including biodiversity and this war also reinforces the danger of continued dependence on oil and gas fossil-fuels.
This emergency statement was unanimously adopted by the Steering Committee of the Global Ecosocialist Network on February 27. It will be submitted to our next general membership meeting, on March 13, for discussion and ratification.
Thank you for maintaining your rage about universal human rights abuse. Your voice for refugee rights has been a blow torch on mandatory indefinite detention of innocent men women and children, a wake up call about racism, discrimination and state sponsored torture. Long may you live.
We condemn unequivocally the Russian invasion of Ukraine and express our solidarity with the suffering people of Ukraine and antiwar protests in Russia.
We oppose NATO escalation as disastrous for both the people of Ukraine and the people of Europe.
