New Delhi, June 4 UNI Driven by petroleum products, gems and jewellery, electronic goods and readymade garments among others, India's merchandise exports rose 16.87 year-on-year in June 2022 to $37.94 billion as compared to $32.49 billion in the same month last year.According to preliminary trade data released by Commerce and Industry Ministry on Monday, merchandise exports surged 51.02 in June 2022 to $63.58 billion as compared to $42.1 billion in June 2021 leading to widening of the trade deficit.The trade deficit in June 2022 stood at worryingly high level of $25.63 billion as compared to $9.61 billion in June 2021."Despite an expected fall in the gold imports, the merchandise trade deficit widened further to a worrying $25.6 billion in June 2022, with a sequential dip in exports and a rise in the non gold imports relative to May 2022. With a steady uptick in the size of the merchandise trade deficit over the course of the quarter, we expect the current account deficit to more than double to $30 billion in Q1 FY2023, from the modest $13 billion in the previous quarter," said Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, ICRA.The trade data showed value of non-petroleum exports in June 2022 was $30.12 billion, registering a positive growth of 5.53 over non-petroleum exports of $28.54 billion in June 2021.Value of non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery exports in June 2022 was $26.75 billion, registering a positive growth of 4 over non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery exports of $25.72 billion in June 2021."Petroleum products 98.01, electronic goods 50.66 and RMG of all Textiles 44.67 led the way in high increase in exports during June 2022," said Commerce Ministry.Engineering goods which account for nearly one-fourth of the total merchandise exports from the country fell 1.57 in June 2022 to $9.14 billion as compared to $9.29 billion in June 2021. Commenting on trade data, EEPC India Chairman Mahesh Desai said that slowdown in the world economy emanating largely from the Russia-Ukraine war is likely to dampen global trade. He noted that engineering goods export has been affected as a result of negative spillover of the global headwinds.In what reflected high energy prices in the international market, India's petroleum, crude and products import doubled to $20.73 billion in June 2022 as compared to $10.67 billion in June 2021. Imports of coal, coke and briquettes soared 242 to $6.41 billion as compared to $1.87 billion in June 2021.Gold imports rose 169 to $2.61 billion in June 2022 from $969 million in June 2021."Crude and coal were responsible for around three-fourth of the YoY rise in merchandise imports in June 2022, driving the widening of the current account deficit," Aditi Nayar said.UNI NK
