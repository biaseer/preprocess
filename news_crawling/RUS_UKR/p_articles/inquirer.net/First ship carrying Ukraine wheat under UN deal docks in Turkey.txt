The Belize-flagged vessel is the first to carry wheat from Ukraine through the Black Sea since Russias invasion. The Sormovsky was loaded with 3,050 mt of wheat and had left Ukraines port of Chornomorsk on Friday.
A total of 18 ships have now departed from Ukraine over the past two weeks, following the deal with Russia to allow a resumption of grain exports from Ukraines Black Sea ports, after they were stalled for five months due to the war.
The agreement, brokered by the United Nations along with Turkey, was reached last month amid fears that the loss of Ukrainian grain supplies would lead to severe food shortages and even outbreaks of famine in parts of the world.
