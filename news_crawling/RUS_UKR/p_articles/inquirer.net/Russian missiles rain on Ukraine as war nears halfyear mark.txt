In the south, Russian forces conducted a successful assault on the village of Blahodatne on the border between the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, it said. The city of Mykolaiv was hit with multiple S-300 missiles early on Sunday, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram.
In a daily Facebook update, Ukraines general staff reported several attempted Russian assaults over the past 24 hours in Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine partially controlled by pro-Moscow separatists.
While investigators said they were considering all versions when it came to establishing who was responsible, the Russian Foreign Ministry speculated there could be a link to Ukraine, something a Zelensky adviser dismissed.
The Financial Times, in an article published Sunday, quoted Gennady Gatilov, Moscows ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, as saying Erdogan had tried to facilitate dialogue. But he dismissed speculation about talks between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying there was not any practical platform for having this meeting, the report said.
Of particular concern was the shelling of Nikopol, a city near Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine and Europes biggest nuclear plant.
Artillery shells rained down on a city near Europes biggest nuclear plant and Russian missiles struck near the Black Sea port of Odesa on Sunday, as Ukraine warned of the potential for more serious attacks by Russia as the war neared its six-month anniversary.
Russia said on Sunday the missiles had destroyed an ammunition depot containing missiles for U.S.-made HIMARS rockets. Kyiv said a granary had been hit.
Putin ordered what he called a special military operation to demilitarise its smaller neighbour and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and Western backers accuse Moscow of waging an imperial-style war of conquest.
Ukraine, of course, had nothing to do with this because we are not a criminal state, like the Russian Federation, and moreover we are not a terrorist state, Mykhailo Podolyak said on Ukrainian television, suggesting the incident was Karmic payback for supporters of Moscows invasion.

Local authorities also reported overnight missile attacks in Ukraines Odesa region, home to ports critical to a U.N.-brokered plan to help Ukrainian agricultural exports reach world markets again.
In his nightly video address on Sunday, Zelensky said he had discussed all the threats with French President Emmanuel Macron and word had been sent also to other world leaders including Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
Wednesday marks 31 years of Ukraines independence from Soviet rule as well as half a year since the invasion and President Volodymyr Zelensky called for vigilance, saying Moscow could try something particularly ugly.

As Ukraine prepared to mark its Independence Day embroiled in a war that has flattened towns and cities, killed thousands and forced millions to flee, officials reported more Russian strikes on targets in the east and south of the country.
Russian authorities were investigating a suspected car bomb attack outside Moscow that killed the daughter of Alexander Dugin, an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue who advocates Russia absorbing Ukraine.
The fighting in the proximity of Zaporizhzhia and Saturdays missile strike on the southern Ukrainian town of Voznesensk, not far from Ukraines second-largest atomic plant, spurred fears of a nuclear accident.
Russias defence ministry said its forces had destroyed two M777 Howitzers in combat positions in the Kherson region, and a fuel depot in the Zaporizhzhia region.
Five Russian Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from the Black Sea at the region overnight, a regional administration spokesperson said, citing information from the southern military command. Two were shot down by Ukrainian air defences and three hit agricultural targets, but there were no casualties.
A series of explosions have made headlines in recent weeks from Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Telegram post by Mikhail Razvozhayev, Crimeas Russian-appointed governor, who is not recognised by the West, said a drone attack on the headquarters of Russias Black Sea fleet had been thwarted on Saturday morning.
All of Ukraines partners have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week, Zelensky said, referring to Russia.FEATURED STORIES
