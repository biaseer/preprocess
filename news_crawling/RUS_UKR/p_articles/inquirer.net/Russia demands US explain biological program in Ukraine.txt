LONDON  Russia demanded on Wednesday that the United States explain to the world why it had supported what Moscow cast as a military biological program in Ukraine.
We confirm facts, unearthed as part of the special military operations, which testify to an emergency attempt to erase evidence of military biological programs, Zakharova told reporters.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova demanded transparency from Washington over the allegation, which is denied by Kyiv and which a Pentagon spokesman has described as absurd.
In response to earlier Russian allegations about the purported military biological program in Ukraine, a Pentagon spokesman said on Tuesday: This absurd Russian misinformation is patently false.

At her briefing, Zakharova said: The U.S. Defense Department and the presidential administration of the United States are obliged to officially explain to the global community, officially, not through talking heads, about the programs in Ukraine.
