According to the office chief, the attacks on Russia must be swift and without hesitation, otherwise the Kremlin will try to split the EU and pursue its own blackmail.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the Russian Federation is trying to disrupt Ukrainian grain shipments even via alternative routes.
Russia has blocked all ports and trade routes through which Ukrainian grain is traditionally exported worldwide. More than 20 million tonnes of grain remain stuck in Ukrainian ports and silos.
"It cannot be ruled out that Russia, in addition to the food crisis, will start blackmailing Europe over gas with the onset of cold weather. Given that the Kremlin now wants to exchange the unblocking of Ukrainian ports for sanction lift, we can see Moscow's ultimate goal. "Economic support for Ukraine, tariffs and embargoes on Russian oil, sanctions against the Russian banking system, auxiliary sanctions, as well as the weapons requested by our state are a strong, united response," Yermak wrote.
The head of the Ukrainian President's Office, Andriy Yermak, made the statement on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
