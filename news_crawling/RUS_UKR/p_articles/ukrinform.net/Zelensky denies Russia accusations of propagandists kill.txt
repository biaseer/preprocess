As reported earlier, on August 20, a car blew up in the suburbs of Moscow, allegedly driven by Darya Dugina, the daughter of the main ideologist behind the notorious "Russian world" concept, Alexander Dugin.
"It is definitely not our responsibility, she is not a citizen of our country, we are not interested in her, and she is not on the territory of Ukraine," Zelensky said, answering a question regarding Russias accusations of Ukraine's involvement in the assassination of Darya Dugina.
The president touched upon the topic during a press conference on Tuesday, August 23, Ukrinform reports.
In March 2022, Dugina was put on the U.S. sanctions list, and in June she was also sanctioned by the UK.
Dugina, 29, hosted a Telegram channel, which she used to publicly support Russia's war on Ukraine. She also appeared as an expert on panel shows and gave lectures at a far-right bookstore.
