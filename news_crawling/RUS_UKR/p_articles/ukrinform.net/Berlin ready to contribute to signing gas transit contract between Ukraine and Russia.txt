Seibert declined to predict how the gas pipeline issue will be discussed at a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the evening of July 12. He added that both leaders would make brief press statements.
"For us, in connection with Nord Stream 2, it is clear and important that Ukraine remains a transit country for gas. We have campaigned for this and, thank God, we can contribute, together with the European Union, to the signing of a gas transit contract between Ukraine and Russia. Thus, the course has been determined," Seibert said.
He recalled that the gas transit contract, signed at the end of 2019, would be valid until the end of 2024 and envisaged its possible extension until 2034.
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert said this at a briefing on Monday, July 12.
