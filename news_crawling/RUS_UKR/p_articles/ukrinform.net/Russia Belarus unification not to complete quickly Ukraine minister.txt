As reported, on September 9, after more than three hours of talks with Alexander Lukashenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that all 28 programs of the "Union State" of Russia and Belarus had been agreed.
In the face of mass protests in 2020, the Lukashenko regime was able to survive in large part thanks to the Kremlin's support and Russian loans. At the same time, Russia demands that the two countries continue "in-depth integration" within the "Union State."
"It seems to me that despite the fact that today the situation in Belarus has changed a lot compared to previous years, the moods, even among those who are in power in Belarus today are not really about uniting," Reznikov said.
He noted that he would not like to base any conclusions on assumptions, adding he had a feeling that "this will be a long history, so it wont complete so quickly according to e plan that is commonly referred to as restoration of the empire."
