The United States prefers the path of diplomacy but will continue to provide Ukraine the defensive assistance needed to defend against Russia.
Since the end of October, Russia has been amassing troops near Ukraine's borders. Western media reported, citing sources, that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could take place in early 2022, involving about 175,000 Russian troops.
In this regard, the United States, Britain and other international partners provide Ukraine with defensive weapons. In particular, anti-tank weapons from Great Britain arrived in Ukraine on January 18.
