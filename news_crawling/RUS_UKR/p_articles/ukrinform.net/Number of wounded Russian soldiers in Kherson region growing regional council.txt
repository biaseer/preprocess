Yurii Sobolevskyi, the first deputy chairman at Kherson Regional Council, wrote this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
According to him, about 40 doctors, brought from Russia, tried to occupy houses abandoned by their owners, but the locals drove them out. Now the military doctors are forced to live in a hospital building.
In the past day, the Ukrainian military eliminated 32 Russian invaders on the southern axis, with Ukrainian aircraft launching three strikes on enemy strongholds.
"The orcs in the Kherson region are suffering significant losses. The number of those wounded is constantly growing, which led to the deployment of a military hospital at a hospital in Beryslav," Sobolevskyi said.
