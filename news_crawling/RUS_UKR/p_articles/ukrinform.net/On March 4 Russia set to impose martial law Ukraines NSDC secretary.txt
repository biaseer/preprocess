He also noted that many Russians who hold positions in government dont understand what is going on in Putin's head.
The statement came as Danilov was speaking on the air of Ukraine 24 TV, answering questions about the possible application for martial law in Russia.
"First, this is the data available to our intelligence that from March 4, the Russian Federation is set to indeed impose martial law in the country. Id like to see how Moscow and St. Petersburg, where theres a lot of intellegenzia, will react to this, as they understand what is happening in the Russian Federation. Today, if Putin lacks cannon fodder, he can take children hes drafting into the army to deploy here, into our meat grinder. I don't understand why hes doing this," Danilov stressed.
"Bombing our peaceful cities, bombing Kharkiv, bombing historic cities, killing children  what were you even thinking to commit all this?" said Danilov.
"Then I must say that 95 of the citizens of our country must be killed," Danilov said.
He also recalled the statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei avrov about the intention to remove nationalists from Ukraine.
