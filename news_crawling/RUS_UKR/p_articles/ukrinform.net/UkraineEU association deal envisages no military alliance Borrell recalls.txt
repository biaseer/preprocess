This was stated by EU High Representative Josep Borrell, who spoke at a press conference in Brussels on Tuesday, following a meeting of the EU defense ministers, Ukrinforms own correspondent reported.
Recalling the association deal, as well as the Eastern Partnership, the EU High Representative has noted EUs solidarity with Ukraine and engagement in efforts to protect and uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity, adding that such efforts will continue the same way.
He noted that the EU is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine. According to the official, the EU has at its disposal the information on the current situation on the eastern border of Ukraine, provided only by the Ukrainian and American partners.
At the same time, Borrell recalled that the bilateral Association Agreement concluded by the EU and Ukraine covers a wide range of issues, while not providing for setting up a military alliance.
As Ukrinform reported earlier, citing the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's Main Intelligence Directorate, as of early November, a nearly 90,000-strong grouping of Russian troops had amassed near the Ukrainian border and in the territories temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation. The governments of the United States, Germany, and France, NATO Allies, and key EU institutions have expressed solidarity with Ukraine and warned Russia against escalating military tensions around Ukraine.
Noting that the EU has no military alliance with Ukraine, Borrell said that, if the question arises of what the bloc will do facing the fact of what may happen at the border, the EU will continue to act in exactly the same way, within the efforts that have been taken since Russia seized Crimea and started the war in Donbas. He emphasized that Ukraine could be confident in political, diplomatic, economic, and financial support on the part of the European Union," Borrell said.
