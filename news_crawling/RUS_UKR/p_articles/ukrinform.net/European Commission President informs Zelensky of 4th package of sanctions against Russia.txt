The European Union, along with key international partners, has imposed a package of sanctions on Russia's economy, Russian officials, and oligarchs, including Putin himself, which will be further stepped up if Russia continues its aggression.
On February 24, 2022, Russian president Putin launched an unprovoked war against Ukraine. Russian troops began destroying Ukrainian cities and towns using MLRS, airstrikes, and missile attacks. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, territorial defense units, and the entire people of Ukraine repel the invaders and inflict significant losses on them.
The official noted that the EU had supported Ukraine with a 1.2 billion macro-financial assistance package and 500 million in humanitarian aid.
Discussed with President of the European Commission von der Leyen the EUs support for Ukraine in countering Russian aggression. Increasing sanctions pressure on Russia is important. We also appreciate significant financial assistance. Ukraine continues to move towards membership in the EU, Zelensky wrote on Twitter.
Putin's war is becoming more brutal by the day. I just informed President of Ukraine Zelensky of the 4th package of sanctions. The EU is with the Ukrainian people, von der Leyen posted on Twitter.
