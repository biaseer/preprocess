The Deputy Prime Minister told how he had recently discussed this issue with his colleagues from France and Germany and explained to them that Ukraine did not criticize the Normandy format. According to him, "we are satisfied with this format, but Ukraine criticizes the result which has not been achieved in seven years" because the war is not over, Russia has not withdrawn its troops and has not liberated the occupied Ukrainian territory.
"We need to preserve the Normandy format and give it a chance. But this does not mean that other partners cannot join this format. We are completely open. We talk not about narrowing but, on the contrary, about expanding the format," Reznikov said in the program "Freedom of Speech" on the ICTV channel, an Ukrinform correspondent reported.
As reported, Reznikov stated that the participation of the United States as the OSCE member and the guarantor of the Budapest Memorandum was possible and acceptable at the level of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group.
