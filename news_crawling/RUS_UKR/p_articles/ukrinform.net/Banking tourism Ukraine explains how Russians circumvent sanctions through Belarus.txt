Also, according to the head of the Presidents Office, there is a demand for opening accounts in Uzbekistans banks.
As Ukrinform reported, on March 29, President Volodymyr Zelensky said an expert group was being set up at the Presidents Office to analyze the sanctions impact on Russia.
Yermak recalled that Visa and MasterCard cards issued in Russia cannot be used abroad for international online payments, while both card giants suspended operations in Russia on March 6 in the wake of Kremlins war against Ukraine.
"Russians are bypassing sanctions through Belarus. Now trips to Minsk as part of the so-called banking tourism to get Visa and MasterCard cards in Belarusian banks have become popular. They can be used to make payments abroad and in international online stores," he said.
This was reported by the chief of the Ukrainian Presidents Office, Andriy Yermak, on Telegram, as seen by Ukrinform.
The group is led by the head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, and the chief of the Freeman-Spogli Institute for International Studies FSI, Ambassador Michael McFaul, the U.S. President's National Security Advisor.
