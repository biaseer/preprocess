According to him, Russian troops were shooting at Ukrainian territory, having fired two or three missiles.
As reported earlier, on February 24, the head of the aggressor power, Vladimir Putin, announced the start of the so-called special military operation in Donbas. The invasion was launched including from the territory of Belarus.
Lukashenko claims this was a forced step due to the fact that Ukrainian missile battalions were deployed a few kilometers from the border with Belarus, ready to "strike within minutes" at Russian positions on the territory of the neighboring country.
