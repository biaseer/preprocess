This was stated by the Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Oksana Markarova, who spoke at the national telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
"These are not accidental strikes. We are working now, our Ministry of Information Policy together with the State Department ... fully analyzing all satellite maps, and deliberate targeting of universities, museums, that is, our cultural heritage, is very obvious, Markarova stressed.
The diplomat added that the United States can help Ukraine not only preserve its heritage, but also keep track of what is "already under attack by Russia."
As reported, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy recorded 367 war crimes that the Russian army had committed against the cultural heritage of Ukraine.
