This is said in a statement published on the website of the European External Action Service.
On 1 June, a so-called Russia-run court in the Ukrainian city Simferopol sentenced in absentia Mr Refat Chubarov, Chairman of the Mejlis, the Crimean Tatar Peoples self-governing body, to six years of prison and a fine for politically-motivated charges. The European Union does not recognise Russias illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula and therefore does not, and will not, recognise this sentence by an illegal court," the statement reads.
The sentencing of Chubarov constitutes a serious violation of his human rights and another example of the persecution of the Crimean Tatar community by the Russian authorities.It further illustrates the severe deterioration of human rights on the Crimean peninsula since its illegal annexation.
The EU reiterates that all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens on the Crimean peninsula must be released immediately.
