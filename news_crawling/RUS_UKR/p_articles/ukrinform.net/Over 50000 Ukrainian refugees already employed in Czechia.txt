According to the Interior Ministry, some 345,200 refugees have so far been granted special visas in the Czech Republic. Nearly two-fifths of that number are children.
The publication says the humanitarian visas, valid for 24 months, guarantee refugees the same status on the labor market as Czech citizens or permanent residents.
