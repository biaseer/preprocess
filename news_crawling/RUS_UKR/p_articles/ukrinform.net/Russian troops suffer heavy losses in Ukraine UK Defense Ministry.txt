"Russian units suffering heavy losses have been forced to return to Belarus and Russia to reorganize and resupply," the statement reads.
The ministry also believes that Russia's stated focus on an offensive in Donetsk and Luhansk is likely a tacit admission that it is struggling to sustain more than one significant axis of advance.
The Defense Ministry added that such activity is placing further pressure on Russia's already strained logistics and demonstrates the difficulties Russia is having reorganizing its units in forward areas within Ukraine.
According to the statement, Russia will likely continue to compensate for its reduced ground maneuver capability through massive artillery and missile strikes on Ukrainian cities.
On February 24, Russian President Putin announced the beginning of a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops have been shelling and destroying infrastructure, residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.
The British Defense Ministry said this in its latest intelligence update posted on Twitter, Ukrinform reports.
