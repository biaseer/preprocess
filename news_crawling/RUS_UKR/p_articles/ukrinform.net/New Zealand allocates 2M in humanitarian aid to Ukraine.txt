"It is deeply disturbing to hear reports of the growing numbers of deaths and injuries from this conflict. The harrowing and horrific images of displaced or suffering civilians in Ukraine speak volumes of this unfolding tragedy, and underlines the consequences of Russia's unprovoked aggression," Foreign Minister of New Zealand Nanaia Mahuta said, Ukrinform reports citing Radio New Zealand.
Russian president Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine on February 24 and launched a large-scale invasion. Russian troops have been shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities. Missiles hit residential buildings.
Mahuta repeated New Zealands call for Russia to cease military operations in Ukraine, immediately withdraw, and return to diplomatic negotiations to de-escalate the conflict.
As noted, the funding will go towards supporting health facilities on the ground and providing basic needs  such as food and hygiene items.
Ukraine officially filed a lawsuit against the Russian Federation at the UN International Court of Justice in The Hague.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine, with the support of all Ukrainian people, courageously resist the Russian aggression.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the losses of the Russian army currently total about 4,500 people.
