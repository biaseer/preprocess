"The Russians planned to redeploy personnel and heavy armored vehicles across a pontoon crossing over the Siversky Donets River near Serebryanka. But the Russians forcing the river is mission impossible due to 30 SMB soldiers and other security forces, the statement reads.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine dealt a significant blow to Russian troops. As a result, the Russians lost at least one battalion tactical group. Their pontoon crossing equipment was disabled during the attempt and several vehicles were destroyed, with several dozen personnel eliminated.
As Ukrinform reported, from February 24 to May 21, Ukrainian defenders eliminated about 28,850 Russian servicemen, including 150 in the past day.
