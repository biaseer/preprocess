We just bought 4 more modern Estonian made recon drones EOS C VTOL which we named Magyla for additional 660 000 euro. Total value - 990 000 euro. Ukrainian pilots are learning how to operate them. Four birds will travel to Ukraine right now, the rest in 2 months, Andrius Tapinas, Lithuanian TV presenter, public figure, posted on Twitter.
On February 24, Russia launched a new phase of the eight-year war against Ukraine  a full-scale offensive. The enemy massively shells and bombs peaceful Ukrainian cities, towns, and villages. The Armed Forces, the National Guard, the Territorial Defense Forces and the entire Ukrainian people effectively resist and inflict heavy losses on Russian troops.
