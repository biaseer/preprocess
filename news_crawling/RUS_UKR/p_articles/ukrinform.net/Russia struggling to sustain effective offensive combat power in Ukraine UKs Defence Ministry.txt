Russia has struggled to sustain effective offensive combat power since the start of the invasion and this problem is likely becoming increasingly acute, the British Ministry of Defence posted on Twitter.
Russias stated immediate policy objective is to seize all of Donetsk region, the UKs Ministry of Defence underscores.
It is noted that as well as dealing with severe under-manning, Russian planners face a dilemma between deploying reserves to the Donbas or defending against Ukrainian counterattacks in the southwestern Kherson sector.
As reported, the Ukrainian troops eliminated about 38,550 Russian invaders between February 24 and July 19.
While Russia may still make further territorial gains, their operational tempo and rate of advance is likely to be very slow without a significant operational pause for reorganisation and refit, says the report.
