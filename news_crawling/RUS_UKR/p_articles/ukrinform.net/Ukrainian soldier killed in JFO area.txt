In the area of Prychepylivka 50km north-west of Luhansk, the enemy forces opened fire from small arms.
Towards Marinka 23km south-west of Donetsk, the occupiers launched two attacks, using 12mm artillery and 82mm mortars.
Today, Russian-occupation troops violated the ceasefire four times, including three times with the use of the weapons banned under the Minsk agreements, the press center of the JFO Headquarters posted on Facebook.
Without resorting to weapons prohibited under the Minsk agreements, Ukrainian defenders returned fire and forced the enemy to cease shelling.
The command and personnel of the Joint Forces offer their sincere condolences to the family and friends of the hero who died for Ukraine.
