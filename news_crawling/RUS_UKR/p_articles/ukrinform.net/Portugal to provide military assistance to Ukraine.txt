"At the request of the Ukrainian authorities, Portugal will provide military equipment such as vests, helmets, night vision goggles, grenades and ammunition of various calibers, portable radios, analog repeaters and G3 automatic rifles," the statement said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that martial law was being imposed across Ukraine. Early on February 24, the Verkhovna Rada approved Zelensky's decree on the imposition of martial law throughout Ukraine.
Ukrinform reported earlier that the head of the aggressor country, Vladimir Putin, announced the beginning of a special military operation in Donbas. At about 04:00, Russia launched air strikes on Ukraine and started the war.
