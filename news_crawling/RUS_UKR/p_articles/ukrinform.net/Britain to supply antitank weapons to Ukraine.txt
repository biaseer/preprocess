"We have taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapon systems," British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told Parliament on January 17, Reuters reports.
As reported, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently held telephone talks with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, reaffirming his resolve to "to respond swiftly and strongly to any further Russian invasion into Ukraine."
"They these systems are not strategic weapons and pose no threat to Russia. They are to use in self-defence," the British official noted.
Wallace noted he had invited Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to visit London in the next few weeks to discuss the crisis around Ukraines borders.
