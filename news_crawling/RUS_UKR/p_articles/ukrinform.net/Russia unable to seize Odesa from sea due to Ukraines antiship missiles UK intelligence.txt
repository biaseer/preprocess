The British intelligence added that Russia would continue to prioritise efforts to destroy Ukraines anti-ship capability. However, Russias targeting processes are highly likely routinely undermined by dated intelligence, poor planning, and a top-down approach to operations.
It is noted that Russian cruise missiles hit Ukraines Odesa port. The Russian MoD claimed to have hit a Ukrainian warship and a stockpile of anti-ship missiles. There is no indication that such targets were at the location the missiles hit, the report reads.
The UK Ministry of Defense said this in its latest intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine, Ukrinform reports.
Russia almost certainly perceives anti-ship missiles as a key threat which is limiting the effectiveness of their Black Sea Fleet. This has significantly undermined the overall invasion plan, as Russia cannot realistically attempt an amphibious assault to seize Odesa, the report reads.
As reported, on July 23, the Russian forces struck the Odesa port with Kalibr cruise missiles. Two missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defense forces. Two other missiles hit the ports infrastructure facilities.
