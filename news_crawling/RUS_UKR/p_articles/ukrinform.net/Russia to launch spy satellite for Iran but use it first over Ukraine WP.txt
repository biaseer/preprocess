The satellites camera boasts a 1.2-m resolution, which substantially improves Irans current capabilities, the report says.
Russia, which has struggled to achieve its military objectives in its five-month-old assault on Ukraine, has told Tehran that it plans to use the satellite for several months, or longer, to enhance its surveillance of military targets in that conflict, WP says.
Russias Roscosmos space agency said it would launch the spacecraft on August 9, fulfilling a deal negotiated with Iran over the past four years.
Russia agreed to build and launch the Kanopus-V system, which will include a high-resolution camera that would give Tehran unprecedented capabilities, including near-continuous monitoring of sensitive facilities in Israel and the Persian Gulf, the report reads.
The pending launch is the latest indicator of increased military and political cooperation between Moscow and Tehran.
A new satellite that Russia is set to launch on Irans behalf next week will massively improve Tehrans ability to spy on military targets in the Middle East. At the same time, Moscow first intends to use it to assist its invasion of Ukraine, the report says.
