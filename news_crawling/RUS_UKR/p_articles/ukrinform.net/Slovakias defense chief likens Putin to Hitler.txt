In the words of Slovakias Defence Minister, Ukraine is literally fighting for the future of Europe.
As Ukrinform reported, President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda stated that Putin and the Russian army were committing unprecedented crimes in Ukraine, as Hitler and the SS once were.
Mr. Jaroslav Nad' stressed that the only thing he considers now was the lives that can be saved in Ukraine.
"Mr. Putin, he Jaroslav Na - ed. said, is equal to Hitler and must be stopped in Ukraine before he can move further West, reads the article.
Russia is killing thousands of people in Ukraine and I am not going to count the votes that I would lose - or gain - based on the decisions of the government to help. The only thing that I am counting is the lives we can save in Ukraine, the minister said.
But this is the worlds new reality. We are a frontline state. We have war on our border and more than 330,000 Ukrainians coming to our country. The paradigm is completely different now, said the Slovak minister in the interview.
Mr. Jaroslav Nad' said it would have been unthinkable before Russias invasion for his country to send large quantities of weapons across its eastern border free of charge.
