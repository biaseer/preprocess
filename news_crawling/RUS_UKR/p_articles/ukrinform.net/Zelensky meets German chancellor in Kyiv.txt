The German chancellor has repeatedly said in recent times that Germany has provided EUR 1.83 billion in aid to Ukraine since 2014 and is Ukraines largest bilateral donor.
The beginning of the meeting was broadcast live on the Facebook page of the Ukrainian President's Office.
The Ukrainian president greeted the German chancellor on the doorstep of the Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv, an Ukrinform correspondent reported.
As Ukrinform reported, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz before his visits to Kyiv and Moscow once again warned Russia of immediate sanctions if it invades Ukraine. Scholz said that both of his visits were aimed at ensuring peace in the face of a very serious threat.
