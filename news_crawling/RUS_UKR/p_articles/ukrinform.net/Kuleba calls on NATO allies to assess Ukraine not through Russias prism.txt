As reported, on November 18, Kuleba said that during the talks in Washington and Brussels, Ukraine had mobilized key Euro-Atlantic partners in support of our country and was currently developing a comprehensive package to deter Russia from expanding its aggression.
At the same time, you should not close your eyes to elephant in the room. Some NATO Allies still look at Ukraine through the prism of their relations with Russia. Addressing them, I once again emphasize: assess Ukraine according to its deserts, not through the prism of Russia, the Foreign Minister stressed.
If they change their approach, the situation will also change significantly for the benefit of Ukraine. And we are working towards this, Kuleba added.
The minister expressed confidence that the reforms would be continued and Ukraine would meet all the necessary criteria for joining NATO and the EU.
In an interview with CNN, Kuleba noted that all official documents and comments of the Biden administration on Ukraine took note of recent successes, including the launch of judicial reform and ensuring macro-financial stability of the country.
