The legislation expands the list of grounds for banning a political party through the courts. Relevant grounds are justifying, recognizing as lawful or denying armed aggression against Ukraine, including by presenting armed aggression of the Russian Federation andor the Republic of Belarus against Ukraine as an internal conflict, civil conflict, or civil war.
The Verkhovna Rada on May 3 passed a law introducing amendments to certain legislative acts of Ukraine regarding a ban on the activity of political parties.
It is expected that if a party is banned by the court, its property, funds and other assets become the property of the state.
