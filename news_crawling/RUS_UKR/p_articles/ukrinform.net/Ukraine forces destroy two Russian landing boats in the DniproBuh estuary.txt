The threat of missile strikes from the sea, air, and the temporarily occupied territories also remains relevant.
Faced with the issue of replenishing manpower to create new strike groups in the south, the Russians are now trying to compensate for the drawback with air and artillery strikes.
The Russian boats, intended for Russias sabotage and recon operations, were sunk by Ukrainian missile and artillery units in their estuary hideout.
"The rucists tugged two Raptor boats, hit earlier, away from Snake Island to their base in Sevastopol with the remnants of hope to restore them," the Command added.
"Meanwhile, in the Black Sea, the number of Russian warships threatening missile strikes across Ukraine has risen to three, while no landing vessels are being observed in the area.
A total of 21 occupiers were eliminated on Wednesday in the southern direction of the front. Also, the Ukrainian forces destroyed an anti-aircraft system and a self-propelled artillery unit, four T-72 tanks, four armored vehicles, three trucks, three drones, and three field munition depots.
"A couple of enemy Mi-8 helicopters attacked our positions. No losses. But the unmanned reconnaissance drones collecting aerial data over Mykolayiv region never succeeded in reporting it back as they were shot down by our anti-aircraft missile units, the statement said. Mykolaiv was again fired upon by Pion heavy artillery guns and an Uragan MLR system. 203-mm shells were chaotically fired at residential neighborhoods, while cluster munitions smashed industrial infrastructure. A person was killed and at least three were injured."
