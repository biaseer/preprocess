The National Energy and Utilities Regulation Commission NEURC passed the relevant decision on September 29, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
In May 2021, the NEURC banned power imports from Russia and Belarus until October 1.
According to the memo to the decision, in the period from May 26 to September 23, the NEURCH did not receive any appeals regarding the need to resume electricity imports from countries that are not members of the Energy Community.
As reported earlier, due to the entry into force on May 15, 2021, of a new law amending legislation on certification of transmission system operators, the NEURC has been entitled to limit the available bandwidth allocated for daily and monthly auctions in 2021, as regards interstate crossings between Ukraine and countries that are not parties to the Energy Community.
