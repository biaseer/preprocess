Thats according to the Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security Council, Ukrinform reports.
As reported, the Kremlin, through its special services, is preparing an information campaign aimed at discrediting President Volodymyr Zelensky across Western Europe.
The inquiry resulted in the companys official refutation of what turned out to be doctored reports. The chain took to its website to explain that it does not support discrimination against any country or nationality, and that the image that is being shared is unrelated to their company.
In this regard, the Center for Countering Disinformation, together with the Embassy of Ukraine in Japan, turned to the management of the chain in question, Sushinomidori, "to obtain an explanation regarding the provocative billboard."
On August 10, a number of Russian media outlets posted images of what was claimed to be a billboard ad of a restaurant where a Japanese sushi chef covers the mouth of a Ukrainian woman with the call: "Let's change the subject and talk about delicious sushi," the disinformation watchdog wrote in its latest report.
