"They're defending our country while also trying to be very responsible about the Ukrainian citizens because of the very simple fact - they are there to defend Ukraine together with Ukrainian citizens," Markarova stressed.
According to her, the Russian enemy also plans to accuse the Ukrainian Arms Forces to sabotage.
"According to reports obtained by the Security Service of Ukraine, the occupying forces are actively handing out gas masks to local militants and Russian militaries in Donetsk Oblast. I'm making this information public to warn that there might be a possibility of provocation," the ambassador said.
She said this on Saturday during a press briefing in Washington DC, an Ukrinform correspondent reported.
"But we want to declare that, unlike Russian occupants, Ukraine does not resort to such methods," Markarova declared.
