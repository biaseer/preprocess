According to the Crimean Tatar leader, all those who are threatened with a draft call, will receive assistance from the moment they manage to cross the border into other countries.
Then, he said, Crimean residents will be offered "worthy options for participation or assistance in the struggle for the liberation of Crimea from Russian invaders."
It should be recalled that male inhabitants of Crimea are being forcibly mobilized on the temporarily occupied peninsula to take part in the war with Ukraine.
In order to avoid fulfilling criminal orders, men of military age attempt to flee the peninsula through mainland Russia, as the road to mainland Ukraine is now closed. According to the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Liudmyla Denisova, forcible mobilization is prohibited by international humanitarian law, Article 51 IV of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.
"Do your best to avoid being drafted into the Russian occupation army, which will force you to kill your fellow citizens or get you killed by fellow citizens," Chubarov wrote.
He has called on citizens to immediately contact him or other members of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, who are now in mainland Ukraine, via social networks," Chubarov said.
