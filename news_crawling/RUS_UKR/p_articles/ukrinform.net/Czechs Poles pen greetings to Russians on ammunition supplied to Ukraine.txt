As reported, on February 24, Russia launched a new phase of its war against Ukraine  a full-scale invasion. Russian occupiers have been shelling and bombing peaceful towns and villages across Ukraine, torturing and killing civilians. Ukraine's defense forces are fiercely resisting the Russian onslaught.
For instance, the Czech Republic sends ammunition, signed "For the Shot Prague Spring 1968". The Netherlands shells read "Revenge for MH17", while Poles write "For Katyn!"
