"Sanctions on Russia have no connection to the unfolding global food crisis. The sole reason for shortages, rising prices, and threat of hunger is the Russian military physically blocking 22 million tons of Ukrainian food exports in our seaports. Demand Moscow to end its blockade," the top diplomat said.
Russia has earlier blocked all ports and trade routes through which Ukrainian grain is traditionally exported worldwide. More than 20 million tonnes of grain remain stuck in Ukrainian ports due to the blockade.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia is trying to disrupt Ukrainian grain exports even viaalternative routes that are being set up.
