He stressed that every crime and every shelling committed by the Russian troops against Ukrainians unites citizens of Ukraine and its international partners. Russia had not believe in such a solidary and powerful reaction, but the Ukrainians changed this history, Zelensky added.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine and launched a large-scale invasion. Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.
"Ukrainians have shown the world who we really are. Russia has shown what it has turned into. Just think, over the course of Russian invasion, 16 Ukrainian children were killed and 45 children were wounded in Russian shelling in just four days, the President said.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said this in a video address posted on Telegram on Monday, an Ukrinform correspondent reported.
