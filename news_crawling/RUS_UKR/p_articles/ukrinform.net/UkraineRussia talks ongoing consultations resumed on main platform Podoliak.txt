On February 28, the Ukrainian and Russian delegations held the first round of talks in Belarus and traveled to their capitals for consultations on further decisions. Podoliak noted that negotiations between the delegations were difficult, but without any mandatory ultimatums.
The fourth round of talks between Ukraine and Russia began on March 14. After discussions, the talks were paused until March 15.
He added that both parties are discussing general settlement issues, ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.
During the third round of talks with the Russian delegation, which took place on March 7, the Ukrainian delegation received positive results in the context of the logistics of humanitarian corridors.
Podoliak said earlier that the talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations have resumed and a rather difficult discussion was underway between both parties.
According to Podoliak, the Ukrainian delegation did not achieve the results it expected in the talks with Russia. At the same time, both parties agreed to jointly provide humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians, as well as for the delivery of medicines and food to the sites of the fiercest fighting with the possibility of a temporary ceasefire for the period of evacuation.
On March 3, the second round of talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations took place.
Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, announced this on Twitter.
