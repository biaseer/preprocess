On July 22 in Istanbul, after a quadrilateral meeting between Ukraine, Turkey, the UN and Russia, a deal was brokered on the export of grain and other food from Ukrainian ports.
Turkey's Ministry of Defense said that a joint coordination center for monitoring "grain corridors," the creation of which is envisaged by the agreements reached as part of the deal, has already started operating in Istanbul.
He added that agricultural products would be exported by rail through Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.
Ukraine's Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said this in an interview posted on YouTube, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"That is, we will use everything that is available. And we will also use trucks. We have done a lot for this," Kubrakov said.
"We will move to Plan B if Russia continues shelling the port infrastructure, which we already used before. That is, we will use the Danube ports, we will use the railways and load as much grain as possible," the minister said.
