Ive also heard from some that Africans dont really want to be pressured to pick a side or take a certain position. I understand that. None of us want to repeat the Cold War. And Africans have the right to decide their foreign policy positions, free of pressure and manipulation, free of threats, the envoy said.
Thats according to Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, who spoke in Ghana on Friday during her tour across Africa.
The diplomat also noted that good-faith dialogue and negotiations must be held on terms the Ukrainians themselves decide.
She also made it clear that it is due to Russias actions, not those of Ukraine, that dozens of millions in Africa are now facing a threat of famine.
Ive heard many African leaders say they want diplomacy to end the war, and we could not agree more. Moscow and Kyiv will need to find ways to live together in peace. Its always better to solve disagreements at the negotiating table and not on the battlefield. Unfortunately, weve seen no indication that Russia is prepared to accept a diplomatic solution, said the ambassador.
