As reported, on July 26, the head of the Russian foreign ministry stated that Moscow had never refused to sit down at the negotiation table with Ukraine, adding that Kyiv has allegedly not responded to such offers.
To talk with RF, you need to have the right negotiating position. It has 4 simple components: 1. Long-range artillery, MLRS and ACTAMS to destroy Russian logistics. 2. Air defense to protect cities. 3. Shock drones  the best hunters. 4. Armored vehicles for counter-offensives, Podolyak tweeted on Thursday, August 5.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine considers Moscow's declaration of readiness for talks as a way to hinder a Ukrainian Armys counteroffensive.
Thats according to Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the chief of the Ukrainian Presidents Office.
