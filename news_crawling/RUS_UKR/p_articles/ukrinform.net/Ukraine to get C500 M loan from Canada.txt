Canadas loan of up to $500 million is aimed to support economic stability of Ukraine, the country that is bracing for a possible Russian invasion, officials emphasized.
As Ukrinform reported earlier, in January, Canada decided to expand and extend the UNIFIER military training mission, strengthen intelligence cooperation, and send to Ukraine non-lethal defense equipment.
It is noted that this loan will be allocated in addition to the sovereign loan worth $120 million, which was announced in January.
