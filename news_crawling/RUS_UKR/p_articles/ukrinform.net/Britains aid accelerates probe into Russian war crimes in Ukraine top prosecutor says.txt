He shared the plans that the Prosecutor's Office has to develop a Strategy for handling cases of conflict-related sexual violence. According to the PGO, such a strategy will ensure effective prosecution of criminals, while maintaining an approach focused on the protection of victims of violence.
Kostin expressed gratitude to the people of the United Kingdom, who have sincerely supported Ukraine since the first day of the latest stage of the Russian war.
As reported, the UK government has announced a GBP2.5 million aid package for Ukraine to probe war crimes committed by the Russian military.
It is noted that the parties agreed on the need to pursue close cooperation and discussed the possibility of holding several meetings of Ukrainian and British law enforcement officers to increase the effectiveness of international support for the investigation into Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine.
"Your support to Ukraine, in particular regarding cooperation with the International Criminal Court, active work within the framework of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, as well as expert assistance, is very important. It helps prosecutors speed up the investigation of war crimes committed by the Russian army and conduct it in line with best international practices," Kostin said.
