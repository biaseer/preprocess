"Weve managed to return 53 children. Now we are also talking about lawsuits. I set myself the task to record such cases, find where adoptions took place, and we will sue, we will demand that Russia be held accountable, because this is a crime against our state, against our children," Vereshchuk said.
As reported, as of August 25, a total of 376 children were killed and more than 733 were injured in Ukraine as a result of Russian aggression.
According to her, both the parents and relatives of these children, as well as those who know them, can contact the Ministry for Reintegration regarding the search for children that have been kidnapped and taken to Russia.
Deputy Prime Minister - Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk said during a nationwide telethon on Ukrainian TV Channels, Ukrinform reports.
"In each certain case, we find out information, record it, and if we find a child on the territory of the Russian Federation, we do everything to return the child," said Vereshchuk.
