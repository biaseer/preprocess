The senator also noted he would continue engaging in efforts to assist Ukraine on security, intelligence, and diplomacy, Guildhall reports, according to Ukrinform.
Earlier, MEP Raphael Glucksmann France called on the EU to define as its strategic goal defeating Russia militarily.
We must continue closely engaging our partners and allies to present a united stance in strong opposition to Russias aggression, and I will continue working to ensure that Ukraine has the diplomatic, security, and intelligence backing that they so critically need, the lawmaker concluded.
The violent actions and rhetoric that we have seen from Vladimir Putin in recent months represent the latest in a long string of offensive actions by the Russian President. Accelerated Russian aggression will only strengthen U.S. assistance for our Ukrainian partners, and reinvigorate NATOs collective defense posture, Senator Warner said.
