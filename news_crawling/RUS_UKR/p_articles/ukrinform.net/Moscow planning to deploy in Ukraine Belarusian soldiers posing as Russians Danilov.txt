According to his words, now the Chechens in Ukraine are performing the function that was once performed by the Soviet NKVD security operatives, who were shooting those who attempted to retreat. At the same time, the NSDC secretary mentioned the incident that occurred on March 12, where Chechens shot dead 12 wounded Russians in Kyiv region.
"Today, a special operation is being developed in Russia to be conducted on the territory of Belarus. Now they are really willing to put Russian uniforms on Belarusian soldiers. Some of the latter are refusing to fight against our country, but now the FSB and the special services that are there on their territory, are persuading Belarusians to put on Russian uniforms and move into our territory. But we are ready for this, and I warn you: if we find Belarusians here, they will face the same rebuff as the Russians and the Chechens," Danilov said.
This was stated during the "UA: together" telethon by Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
