As reported, on February 21, the Russian president signed decrees recognizing two self-proclaimed entities in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. Agreements between these quasi-republics and Russia provide for military assistance. Russia has thus openly acknowledged its military presence in the said areas.
Zelensky stated this in a video address to the nation, delivered in the late hours of Tuesday, February 22, Ukrinform reports.
According to Zelensky, most of the summit participants have already supported the initiative, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who spoke with the Ukrainian president over the phone on Tuesday.
Leaders of the EU, the United States, Canada, and most democracies across the world have condemned the Kremlin's actions as a direct violation of international law and Russias own international obligations.
For us personally, ending the war is unalterable, its not about any particular platform or format. I am ready to do this both bilaterally and involving other leaders. But Id like to emphasize that the main thing for me is to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, said the head of state.
He noted that the first format that is currently being worked out is the summit of the leaders of the states  permanent members of the UN Security Council, as well as Ukraine, Turkey, and Germany.
