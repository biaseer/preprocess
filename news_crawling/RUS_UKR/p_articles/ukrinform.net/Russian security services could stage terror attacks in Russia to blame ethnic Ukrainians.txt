Thats according to the Center for Countering Disinformation with the National Security and Defense Council, Ukrinform reports.
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops have been shelling and destroying key infrastructure, massively shelling and bombing residential areas.
It is also intended to provide an ethnic coloring to any potential protests that might erupt across the country, related to the sharp deterioration of living conditions of average Russians. Also, these protests might involve provocations of a violent terrorist nature, which the Russian government will claim have been "organized" by ethnic Ukrainians.
As part of the special operation, it is planned to spread appeals to Ukrainians living in Russia to lead a protest movement to overthrow the Putin regime.
From the first days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States, as well as other allies and partners of Ukraine, have imposed tough sanctions and export restrictions targeting Russian economy.
In particular, public opinion leaders outside Russia with an allegedly pro-Ukrainian position could be involved in voicing such calls.
According to the Center, in order to rally Russian society to support the war with Ukraine, Russia's security services are planning an operation aimed at discrediting Ukrainians living in Russia.
In addition, the idea will be further promoted among Russians that the war with Ukraine was inevitable and that the Ukrainians must be exterminated.
