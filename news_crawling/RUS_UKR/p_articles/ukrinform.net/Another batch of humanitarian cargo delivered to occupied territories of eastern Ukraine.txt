As Ukrinform reported, on October 12, humanitarian cargo weighing 39.17 tonnes was delivered to Russia-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
"We would like to thank you for the long-term cooperation between the ICRC and the Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the ministrys order, No.51, of July 17, 2020, the ICRC informs about the intentions to deliver humanitarian aid to the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which are not under the control of the Ukrainian governor, the ICRC wrote in a letter to the Ukrainian ministry.
The cargo was transferred from all member states of the Geneva Conventions that make contributions to the global budget of the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC.
Thus, four trucks carrying humanitarian aid crossed the Novotroitske entry-exit checkpoint, according to the ministry.
