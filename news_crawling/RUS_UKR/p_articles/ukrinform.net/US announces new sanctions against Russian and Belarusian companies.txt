On February 24, Russian president Vladimir Putin started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops shell and destroy key infrastructure, massively fire on residential areas of Ukrainian cities, towns, and villages using artillery, MLRS, and ballistic missiles.
As reported, on March 31, the United States imposed new sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, targeting technology companies to prevent Russia from evading sanctions and buying critical Western technology.
In the coming days, the Commerce Department will also take further action to degrade Russias defense, aerospace, and maritime sectors by adding 120 entities in Russia and Belarus to the sanctions Entity List, Kate Bedingfield, Director of White House Communications, said at a briefing.
Office of Foreign Assets Control "OFAC" of the US Department of the Treasury sanctioned 13 individuals and 21 entities.
Thus, the number of Russian and Belarusian parties added to the sanctions list reached 200 since Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.
The European Union, the United States, and other countries have imposed strong sanctions on Russia as an aggressor state.
As noted, being added to this list means that these entities can no longer get U.S. cutting-edge technology without a license, which will in most, if not all, of these cases be denied.
