"People are waiting for news every day, but certain military operations take days and sometimes weeks. And whats happening now seems to be a kind of stabilization, but in fact its not. Now the enemy is accumulating forces, there is no calm, no stabilization. The Russian army is trying to fulfill its minimum plan  to seize the east of Ukraine. If they continue to change their plans in line with the operational situation, we must understand that their ultimate goal is the whole of Ukraine," said Maliar.
This was announced by Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar, who spoke at the national telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
As Ukrinform reported earlier, according to the General Staff, Russia continues to move troops toward the regions bordering Ukraine. In particular, the occupiers are moving battalion tactical groups from the Eastern and Central Military Districts to the border areas of Belgorod, Voronezh, and Kursk regions.
