The European Congress of Ukrainians is an international coordinating organization representing the interests of Ukrainians in Europe.
The letter says that Russia seeks to destabilize Europe through disinformation and acts of aggression in NATO member countries, such as the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.
"To counter this growing threat from Russia, the European Congress of Ukrainians joins the Bucharest Nine states in calling for enhanced NATO presence in Eastern Europe and greater security in the Black Sea region. A clear message of support for Ukraines MAP will serve to deter further Russian aggression," reads the letter, signed by ECU Chairman Bohdan Rajcinec.
