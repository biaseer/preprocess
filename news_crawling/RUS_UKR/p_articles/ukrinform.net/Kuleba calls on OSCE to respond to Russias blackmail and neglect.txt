Ukraine insists that this mission at Gukovo and Donetsk checkpoints continue to work after July 31. Russias blackmail and contempt for the OSCE can only be stopped by the principled position and actions of the Organization, and Ukraine will always stand by the OSCE in this struggle, Kuleba said
According to the minister, the purpose of these efforts is obvious to everyone  Russia does not want independent OSCE observers to see "any military action taken by Russia along the Ukrainian-Russian border."
As Ukrinform reported, the Russian Federation prevented the standard four-month extension of the mandate of the Observer Mission at the Russian checkpoints at Gukovo and Donetsk, reducing it to two months without objective reasons.
In this context, he recalled that Moscow had refused to explain the buildup of its troops on Ukraines border, which is the responsibility of the OSCE Vienna Document participants, and also undermines confidence by withdrawing from theTreatyonOpen Skies. In addition, in May Russia forced the OSCE to shorten the mandate of the Observer Missionat the Russian checkpoints Gukovo and Donetskon the border with Ukraine, and is now threatening to close these missions completely.
It is very difficult and painful for us in Kyiv to see how Russia consistently neglects the OSCE, Kuleba said.
Kuleba said this at a joint press conference with OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sweden Ann Linde in Kyiv on June 15, an Ukrinform correspondent reports
