"We also appealed to these countries so that they simultaneously close their borders with Belarus and Russia. I think that if such a decision is made, it will not be necessary to wait for the decision of the European Union - we will completely block any supplies to Russia," the ambassador stressed.
"We are holding talks with the Polish Ministry of Infrastructure, with the Polish government, in order to completely close the border between Poland and Belarus - even if the decision is not taken at the level of the European Union," he said.
On March 25, the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine sent a letter to the European Commission with a proposal to completely block transport services with Russia and Belarus.
