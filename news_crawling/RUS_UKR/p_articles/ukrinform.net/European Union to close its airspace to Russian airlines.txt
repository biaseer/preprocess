President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said this in a statement, Ukrinform reports.
According to her, the EU decided to prohibit all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft to land in, take off, or overfly the territory of the EU. This will apply to absolutely all Russian aircraft, including private ones.
In addition, Russian propaganda media outlets will be banned in the EU. RT, Sputnik and their affiliates will no longer be able to spread lies to justify Putin's war, the European Commission chief said. She noted that additional sanctions would be imposed on the Lukashenko regime in Belarus for its role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin, she said.
The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for four days. On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Martial law was imposed in Ukraine. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization.
