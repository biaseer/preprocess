As reported earlier referring to the Office of the Prosecutor General, a Ukrainian An-225 Mriya aircraft, the multiple record-holding cargo giant, was destroyed in Russian shelling at the Antonov airfield in Hostomel.
Russian fascists will be held responsible for every Ukrainian life taken and maimed. An unsuccessful blitzkrieg will end in a successful Nuremberg. And the phrase I was just following orders at the Nuremberg Trials will not save any criminal," the defense minister stressed.
The liberators came with their Russian world to a peaceful, free Ukrainian city with happy families. Today, the whole world sees the results of this liberation," the minister said.
Thats according to Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, who wrote about this on Facebook after visiting Hostomel, a town outside Kyiv, recently granted a Hero title, Ukrinform reports.
"The pain of our people is unimaginable. But I know for sure: our only national dream will become a reality. We will restore and rebuild everything, and all those involved in the crimes against humanity, led by the Kremlin's main actors, will be held accountable not only to the Ukrainian people but also to the international court, added Reznikov.
