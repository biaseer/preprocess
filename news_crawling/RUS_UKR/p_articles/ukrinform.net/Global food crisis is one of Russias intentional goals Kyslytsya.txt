Russia has already stolen about 400,000 tonnes of grain within the temporarily occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Region, Kherson Region, Donetsk Region and Luhansk Region. This accounts to a third of all reserves in these regions.
The relevant statement was made by Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya at a meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Kyslytsya mentioned the UN report, based o which more than 1.7 billion people in the world might be at risk of poverty and hunger as a result of disruptions in the food production system caused by Russias full-scale war against Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation continues to deliberately block the sowing campaign in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian side demands that Russia stop illegal grain theft, unblock Ukrainian ports and restore the freedom of navigation.
In his words, Russia is also attacking grain elevators, agricultural infrastructure and fertilizer depots, as well as stealing agricultural vehicles.
We call on the international community to strengthen economic sanctions against Russia in order to stop its military aggression against Ukraine, prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and the global food crisis, Kyslytsya stressed.
According to Kyslytsya, the robbery of granaries, the blockade of Ukrainian ports and the mining of sea routes are threatening the global food security.
Given that the stolen grain was to be used for the next harvest, this has already increased the threat of famine, Kyslytsya said.
