According to Zelensky, the enemy also lost about 60 aircrafts, more than 80 helicopters and hundreds of other advanced military equipment units, which Russia is proud of.
Our Armed Forces are doing everything to deprive the enemy of any desire to continue the war against Ukraine. The losses of Russian troops are enormous. The dynamics of the invaders losses on the 17th day is such that it is safe to say that this is the biggest blow to the Russian army in decades. Theyve never lost more than that in such a time period, Zelensky said.
The enemys losses in terms of technical capabilities are astounding: more than 360 tanks, 1,205 armored vehicles. And thats without counting the losses in the battles last night and in the morning.
Most of the worlds armies do not have as much as Russian troops lost during the invasion, Zelensky noted.
The relevant statement was made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his video address, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Since the beginning of the invasion, 31 battalion tactical groups of the enemy have lost their combat capability. The Russian militaries are being taken prisoners not just alone, but in groups. Groups are trying to leave Ukraine and come back to Russia as well.
