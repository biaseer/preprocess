The second challenge is to provide a membership perspective, i.e. the readiness of the European Union countries to follow the path of recognizing Ukraine's European perspective. Now, Ukraine already has the prerequisites to acquire such a status. We are a European state, we profess European values, and we fight for these values, including on the front line. Our conditions, which have been laid down in the Association Agreement, are, in fact, in line with the preconditions for the Western Balkans to join the EU," Bodnar said.
Speaking about the Eastern Partnership initiative, Bondar said that the Associated Trio of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova showed the level of ambition of these countries.
He stressed that Ukraine was ready to undertake more commitments under the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. He also drew attention to public support for such a decision in Ukraine.
The issue of security, namely countering Russian aggression, is the main challenge in the process of European integration, Bodnar said. "After all, it was the Russian aggression that began with Ukraine's desire to sign the Association Agreement. We remember it quite well," the diplomat said.
"In principle, we have a positive perception of the European Union and we hope that the Associated Trio will be such a driver of change in the Eastern Partnership policy towards partners," he said.
He stated this at the All-Ukrainian Forum "Ukraine 30. International Relations" on Tuesday, July 6, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
Bodnar also stressed that Ukraine has "quite important and strong partners on its western border" who support Ukraine's EU integration.
