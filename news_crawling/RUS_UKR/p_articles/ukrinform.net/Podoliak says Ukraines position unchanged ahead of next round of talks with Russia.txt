On February 28, the Ukrainian and Russian delegations held the first round of talks in Belarus and traveled to their capitals for consultations on further decisions. Podoliak noted that negotiations between the delegations were difficult, but without any mandatory ultimatums.
During the third round of talks with the Russian delegation, which took place on March 7, the Ukrainian delegation received positive results in the context of the logistics of humanitarian corridors.
"Negotiations. 4th round. On peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops  security guarantees. Hard discussion. Although Russia realizes the nonsense of its aggressive actions, it still has a delusion that 19 days of violence against Ukraine's peaceful cities is the right strategy," he wrote.

According to Podoliak, the Ukrainian delegation did not achieve the results it expected in the talks with Russia. At the same time, both parties agreed to jointly provide humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians, as well as for the delivery of medicines and food to the sites of the fiercest fighting with the possibility of a temporary ceasefire for the period of evacuation.
Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the President's Office, said this on Twitter, Ukrinform reports.
On March 3, the second round of talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations took place.
