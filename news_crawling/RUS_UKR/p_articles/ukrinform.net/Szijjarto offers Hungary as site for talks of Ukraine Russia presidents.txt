He said this before leaving for New York for talks with UN leadership on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ukrinform reports citing Daily News Hungary.
As reported, on February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine and launched a large-scale invasion. Missile strikes hit a number of Ukrainian cities and military facilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
"War is the worst-case scenario that takes human lives," the Hungarian minister said, adding that his country wants to end hostilities as soon as possible and achieve peace.
He reported on Facebook late Friday night that he had consulted with both Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the head of the Ukrainian Presidents office, Andriy Yermak, to offer them Budapest as a safe place to negotiate. According to him, neither side rules out such a possibility.
"With this proposal, Hungary hopes to contribute to the restoration of peace in which it is interested," Szijjarto said.
