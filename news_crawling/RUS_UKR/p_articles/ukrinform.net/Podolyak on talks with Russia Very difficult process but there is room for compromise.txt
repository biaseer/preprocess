During the third round of talks with the Russian delegation, which took place on March 7, the Ukrainian delegation received positive results in the context of logistics of humanitarian corridors.
As reported, the fourth round of talks between Ukraine and Russia began on March 14. After discussions, the parties went on a technical break until March 15. Negotiations resumed on Tuesday.
On February 28, the Ukrainian and Russian delegations held the first round of talks in Belarus and then left for their capitals to consult on further solutions. Podolyak noted that the negotiations had been difficult, but no mandatory ultimatums had been put forward.
According to Podolyak, the Ukrainian delegation did not achieve the results it had hoped for. At the same time, the parties agreed to jointly secure humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians, as well as for the delivery of medicines and food to the sites of the fiercest fighting with the possibility of a temporary ceasefire for the period of evacuation.
We'll continue tomorrow. A very difficult and viscous negotiation process. There are fundamental contradictions. But there is certainly room for compromise. During the break, work in subgroups will be continued... Mykhailo Podolyak, Adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine, posted on Twitter.
On March 3, the second round of talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations took place.
