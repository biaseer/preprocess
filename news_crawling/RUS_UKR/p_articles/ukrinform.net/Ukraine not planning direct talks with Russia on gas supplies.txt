According to him, part of the fuel in underground storage facilities was purchased at a price of UAH 3-4 per cubic meter, part was pumped at a price of UAH 18, and there is also gas of domestic production. Shmyhal believes that such a combination will keep the price of natural gas low for the population until the end of the heating season.
"Such talks are not being planned," Shmyhal said when asked by journalists about possible direct talks with Moscow on additional gas purchases.
He noted that there are more than 18.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas in underground gas storage facilities. At the same time, the first offer for the sale of gas that does not belong to NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine is always made within the state, Shmyhal said.
"Now we feel quite confident in terms of going through the heating season with gas. In principle, as of the end of last week, Ukraine is 90 ready for the heating season," Shmyhal commented.
