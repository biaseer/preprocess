Our people have great strength. It always was and always will be. As long as we believe in ourselves. As long as we keep our unity. And as long as we fight for Ukraine and work for our joint Ukrainian victory, Zelensky wrote.
A reminder that, on February 24, 2022, Russia started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Defense Forces of Ukraine are fiercely fighting against Russian invaders, and the Ukrainian people are helping the defenders as much as they can.
The relevant statement was made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Telegram, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
