As noted, the Ukrainian military returned fire 30 times, without using weapons banned under the Minsk Agreements. The occupiers were forced to stop shelling.
Over the past day, December 12, Russian-occupation troops violated the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine four times. A Ukrainian soldier received a mine-blast trauma, having tripped an enemy explosive device. He was taken to a medical institution. His health status is moderate.
Three defenders were wounded, one was injured in action. The soldiers were promptly taken to medical facilities, where they are provided with the necessary medical care.
"The enemy, provoking the response of Ukrainian soldiers, threw disturbing fire almost along the entire contact line. The number of ceasefire violations by the Russian-occupation forces totaled 36, compared to 29 last week. The enemy launched eight attacks from weapons banned under the Minsk Agreements," the press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports.
