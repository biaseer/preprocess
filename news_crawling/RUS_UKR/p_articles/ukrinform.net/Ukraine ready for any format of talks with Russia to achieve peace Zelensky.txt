In addition, Zelensky noted said that Ukraine, as a responsible country, submitted official requests and tried to contact Russian President Vladimir Putin when the risks of escalation on Ukraine's borders increased due to the buildup of Russian troops.
Zelensky added that Ukraine is also interested in initiatives of other countries that offer assistance in organizing a meeting with the Russian side.
"As soon as Russia says publicly that it is ready to talk about de-escalation, ready to talk about bilateral relations, every time after that we request Russia to hold a meeting in this or that format. But, apart from the public position, in reality they are not willing to communicate with us, they do not want to," the President said.
Zelensky reiterated that Ukraine is ready for talks. "I am ready for any format," he said.
