A reminder that, on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting a war. Russian troops are shelling and destroying the key infrastructure facilities, launching missile and air strikes on Ukrainian cities and villages, torturing and murdering civilians.
In his words, when deciding on sanctions packages, the position of individual states does not matter, as there is a conceptual pro-Ukrainian position across Europe in general.
The seventh package will be on its way. As I understand, it will be able to block all Russian banks, including Sberbank and Gazprombank, Podolyak told.
Why? Because Russias warfare mode has proven that it is not a civilized state, when it violates any rules accepted in the humanistic world, which is Europe, Podolyak noted.
The relevant statement was made by Advisor to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak during a nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
