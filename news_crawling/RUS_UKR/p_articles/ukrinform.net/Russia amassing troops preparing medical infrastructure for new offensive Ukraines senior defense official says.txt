This was stated by Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar on national TV, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
"They are actively preparing for this. Moreover, they are not only beefing up their weapons, military equipment, and personnel, but also preparing medical infrastructure to treat their wounded.
They are accumulating provisions, fully preparing the territory of Belarus for possible outgoing missile strikes. And they are moving troops, changing their strategies a bit, looking for weak spots in our defenses to hit these areas," she said.
As previously reported, Hanna Maliar noted that capturing southern and eastern regions is seen in Russia as their strategic goal before trying again to grab the whole of Ukraine.
