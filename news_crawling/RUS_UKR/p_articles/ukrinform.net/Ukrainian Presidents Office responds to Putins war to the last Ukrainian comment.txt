"Today we hear that they want to defeat us on the battlefield. What can you say, let them try. We have already heard many times that the West wants to fight with us to the last Ukrainian. This is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, but it seems that everything is heading towards this. But everyone should know that, by and large, we haven't started anything yet in earnest," Putin said.
It should be recalled that during a meeting with the Russian State Duma faction leaders on July 7, Putin said Russia had not yet taken any serious action in the course of its "special operation" in Ukraine.
"There is no collective West plan. Only a specific z-army which entered sovereign Ukraine, shelling cities and killing civilians. Everything else is a primitive propaganda. Thats why Mr.Putin's mantra of the war to the last Ukrainian is yet another proof of deliberate Russian genocide," Podolyak tweeted.
