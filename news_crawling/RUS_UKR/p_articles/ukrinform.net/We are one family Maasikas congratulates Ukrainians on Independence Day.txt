He also noted that this is the first Independence Day on which Ukraine is a candidate country for EU membership and emphasized that the EU supports the Ukrainian state, its citizens and Ukrainian defenders, providing billions of euros for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The diplomat said this in his video greeting in Ukrainian on the occasion of Ukraines Independence Day, Ukrinform reports.
Maasikas said that Ukraines 31st Independence Day is like no other because, like every day now, it is also a day of sorrow for those who have fallen, for those who were injured, became victims of Russian atrocities, lost their loved ones and their homes.
"The EU will continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression during reconstruction and on your way to the European Union, because we are one family. We share the same values and we want to live in democracy and prosperity, not in the darkness of totalitarianism. Together, we are Europe! Slava Ukraini!" Maasikas said.
