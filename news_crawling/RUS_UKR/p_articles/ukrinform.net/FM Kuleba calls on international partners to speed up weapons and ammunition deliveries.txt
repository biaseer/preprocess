A reminder that, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Russian troops continue offensive operations in the Eastern operational zone. The enemy is extensively launching strikes all over the contact line and deep into the defense lines of Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk, Slobozhanskyi and Southern Bug operational districts. Most active hostilities are recorded in the Donetsk operational district, near Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk.
The relevant statement was made by Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Twitter, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Too early to conclude that Ukraine already has all the arms it needs. Russian offensive in the Donbas is a ruthless battle, the largest one on European soil since WWII. I urge partners to speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition, especially MLRS, long-range artillery, APCs, Kuleba wrote.
