In his opinion, continued talks are a positive fact as they provide an opportunity to resolve humanitarian issues.
"We have already seen very important success, which is humanitarian corridors. Not all were ensured by Russia, but many did succeed, so thousands of people were saved. Also, the exchange of POWs, although limited, took place, and we hope that this will continue to happen," said Cichocki.
"It is a very good thing that Ukraine, despite the criminal nature of what the Russians are doing here, remains open to negotiations and is constructive in this situation," said the Polish ambassador.
