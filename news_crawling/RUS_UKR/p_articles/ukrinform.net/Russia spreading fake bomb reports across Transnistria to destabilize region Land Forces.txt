"In the Bessarabian direction, Russian special services are taking measures to destabilize the region. Fake bomb reports as regards infrastructure facilities and so-called state institutions in the cities of Tiraspol, Bendery, Dubossary, and Rybnitsa have been spread again," the statement reads.
Control over the south of Ukraine could give Russia another path to Transnistria, where allegedly "the facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population" have been recorded, a Russian military official said.
As Ukrinform reported earlier, Russia's Defense Ministry announced their current objective of the ongoing war in Ukraine: full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine, including the land corridor to Crimea and Transnistria.
This was reported on Telegram by the press service of Ukraine Armys Land Forces, according to Ukrinform.
