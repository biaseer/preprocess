The vigil will host six speakers including New Plymouth mayor Neil Holdom, and Phillipa Parker from the Red Cross, who has lived and worked in numerous war zones.
The canvases will stay at the museum for two days before being taken to different schools around Taranaki to raise awareness of what is happening and allow students to leave their own messages.
Its important to know that we are not alone and that New Zealand is standing in solidarity with Ukraine.
The vigil starts at 4.15pm on Friday, March 25. It can be viewed online here.
There will be several canvases in the Ukranian colours of yellow and blue that those at the vigil can add messages of support to.
She might be 17,000 kilometres from home but Olena Williams is committed to doing whatever she can to help people caught up in the brutal war between Ukraine and Russia.
Its really hard to do something from far away, so I decided to concentrate on humanitarian actions, the New Plymouth woman said.
Williams was born in Russia but was also citizen of Ukraine, where she was raised and lived until she moved to Taranaki 19 years ago.
