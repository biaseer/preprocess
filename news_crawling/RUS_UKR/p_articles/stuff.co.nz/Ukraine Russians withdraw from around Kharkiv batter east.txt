US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to meet his Nato counterparts, including the Turkish foreign minister, this weekend in Germany.
The ministry said the risky river crossing was a sign of the pressure the Russian commanders are under to make progress in their operations in eastern Ukraine.
Russia's offensive aims to encircle Ukraine's most experienced and best-equipped troops, who are based in the east, and to seize parts of the Donbas that remain in Ukraine's control.
This week, the president and prime minister of Finland said they favoured their country seeking Nato membership. Officials in Sweden are expected to announce a decision Sunday on whether to apply to join the Western military alliance.
No-one today can predict how long this war will last, Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address late Friday.
This will depend, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already giving their maximum, he said. This will depend on our partners, on European countries, on the entire free world.

The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament, Anna Kuznetsova, visited Kherson, a region bordering the Black Sea that has been held by Russia since the early days of the war. Russia has installed a pro-Moscow regional administration, and Britains defence ministry said Russia could stage a local referendum on joining Russia, with the results likely manipulated to show majority support for breaking away from Ukraine.
Ukraine appears to have won the Battle of Kharkiv the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think-tank, said. Ukrainian forces prevented Russian troops from encircling, let alone seizing Kharkiv, and then expelled them from around the city, as they did to Russian forces attempting to seize Kyiv.
Britains Defence Ministry said Russia lost significant armoured manoeuvre elements" of at least one battalion tactical group in the attack. A Russian battalion tactical group consists of about 1000 troops.
Airstrikes and artillery barrages make it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around in the east, hindering efforts to get a full picture of the direction the fighting is taking. But the battle appears to be a back-and-forth slog with no major breakthroughs on either side.
Niinist said the discussion was straightforward and unambiguous and was held without exaggeration. Avoiding tensions was considered important.
Fighting was fierce on the Siversky Donets River near the city of Severodonetsk, where Ukraine has launched counterattacks but failed to halt Russias advance, said Oleh Zhdanov, an independent Ukrainian military analyst.
Ukraines general staff said the Russians were pulling back from the northeastern city of Kharkiv and focusing on guarding supply routes, while launching mortar, artillery and airstrikes in the eastern Donetsk province in order to deplete Ukrainian forces and destroy fortifications.
Russian troops are withdrawing from around Ukraines second-largest city after bombarding it for weeks, the Ukrainian military said Saturday local time, as Kyiv and Moscow's forces engaged in a grinding battle for the countrys eastern industrial heartland.
The Ukrainian leader warned that the war was causing a food crisis around the world as a Russian blockade stops Ukrainian grain from leaving port.
Putin told Finnish President Sauli Niinisto that there are no threats to Finlands security and joining Nato would be an error that would negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations.
Regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that there had been no shelling attacks on Kharkiv in the past day.
After Russian forces failed to capture Kyiv following the February 24 invasion, President Vladimir Putin shifted his focus eastward to the Donbas, an industrial region where Ukrainian troops have battled Moscow-backed separatists since 2014.
Ukrainian fighters holed up in a steel plant in the ruined southern port of Mariupol faced continued Russian attacks on the last stronghold of resistance in the city. Ukraines deputy prime minister said Ukrainian authorities are negotiating the evacuation of 60 severely wounded troops from the steelworks. Iryna Vereshchuk said Russia had not agreed to the evacuation of all wounded fighters at the plant, who number in the hundreds.
Russia has captured some Donbas villages and towns, including Rubizhne, a city with a prewar population of around 55,000.
The Nordic nations' potential bids were thrown into question Friday when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country is not of a favourable opinion towards the idea.

However, Russian forces suffered heavy losses in a Ukrainian attack that destroyed a pontoon bridge they were using to try to cross the same river  the largest in eastern Ukraine  in the town of Bilohorivka, Ukrainian and British officials said. It was another sign of Moscows struggle to salvage a war gone awry.
The Group of Seven leading economies echoed that warning, saying Saturday that Russias war of aggression has generated one of the most severe food and energy crises in recent history, which now threatens those most vulnerable across the globe.
Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address that Ukrainians were doing everything they could to drive out the Russians and pushed for the West to increase its support.
Kharkiv, which is not far from the Russian border and only 80km southwest of the Russian city of Belgorod, has undergone weeks of intense shelling. The largely Russian-speaking city with a prewar population of 1.4 million was a key Russian military objective earlier in the war, when Moscow hoped to capture and hold major Ukrainian cities.
