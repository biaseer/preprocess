Lawrey sought the approval of the local Ukrainian community before putting up a social media post at 5pm on Thursday.
He said he was delighted at the turnout in the lunchtime sunshine on the Church Steps on Friday, with many wearing the blue and yellow colours of the Ukrainian flag.
The event was put together at short notice by Nelson city councillor Matt Lawrey after furniture retailer Rob Stevenson alerted him to the call from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for people around the world to stand with his embattled country.
They also planned to send photographs from the event back home to let family members know that people cared about their plight.
Nelson MP Rachel Boyack and the Dean of Christ Church Cathedral Graham O'Brien spoke at the gathering and other Nelson city councillors also attended.
Lawrey said some from the local Ukrainian community were too upset about the devastation of their country to speak publicly, but later told him it meant a lot to see Nelsonians showing their support.
