Explosions and bursts of gunfire shook Kyiv, and heavy artillery fire could be heard from the northwest, where Russia has sought to encircle and capture several of the capital's suburban areas.
Still, the Defence Ministry said Russian forces partially took other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which have been under attack almost since Russia invaded nearly a month ago.
Thousands of civilians are believed to have died. Estimates of Russian military casualties vary widely, but even conservative figures by Western officials are in the low thousands.
Early Tuesday, Ukrainian troops drove Russian forces from the Kyiv suburb of Makariv after a fierce battle, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said. The regained territory allowed Ukrainian forces to retake control of a key highway and block Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest.
Ukraine's Defence Ministry said that troops defending the city had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex. Britain's Defence Ministry said Ukrainian forces "continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy Mariupol.
Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Ukraine, and other AP journalists around the world contributed to this report.
Talks to end the fighting have continued by video. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would be prepared to consider waiving any bid by Ukraine to join Nato  a key Russian demand  in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraines security.
Perched on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is a crucial port for Ukraine and lies along a stretch of territory between Russia and Crimea. The siege has cut the city off from the sea and allowed Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea.
Thousands have managed to flee Mariupol, where the bombardment has cut off electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world. The city council said Tuesday that more than 1100 people who had escaped the siege were in a convoy of buses heading to a city northwest of Mariupol.
The hands of one exhausted Mariupol survivor were shaking as she arrived by train in the western city of Lviv.
A senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity to give the Pentagon's assessment, said Russian ships in the Sea of Azov were shelling Mariupol. The official said there were about seven Russian ships in that area, including a minesweeper and a couple of landing vessels.
In the last update from Mariupol officials, they said March 15 that at least 2300 people had died in the siege. But there are fears the toll could be much higher. Airstrikes over the past week devastated a theater and an art school where many civilians were taking shelter.
But the Red Cross said a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the city with desperately needed supplies still had not been able to enter.
The invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine's population, according to the United Nations.
As part of a series of addresses to foreign legislatures, Zelenskyy urged Italian lawmakers to strengthen sanctions against Moscow, noting many wealthy Russians have homes in the country.
But it's not clear how much of the city Russia holds, with fleeing residents saying fighting continues street by street.
Ukrainian forces fought off continuing Russian efforts to occupy Mariupol and claimed to have retaken a strategic suburb of Kyiv on Tuesday, mounting a defence so dogged that it is stoking fears Russias Vladimir Putin will escalate the war to new heights.
On Monday, Russias pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, citing the Defence Ministry, reported that almost 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. The report was quickly removed, and the newspaper blamed hackers. The Kremlin refused to comment. The Western official said the figure is a reasonable estimate.
From my outreach with various actors, elements of diplomatic progress are coming into view on several key issues, and the gains are enough to end hostilities now, he said. He gave no details.
The Western official, though, said that there were no signs Moscow was ready to compromise.
Putins back is against the wall, said US President Joe Biden, who is heading to Europe this week to meet with allies. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ.
Wildfires broke out near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but Ukraines natural resources minister said the flames had been extinguished and radiation was within normal levels. Chernobyl in 1986 was the scene of the worlds worst nuclear disaster.
Beyond the terrible human toll, the war has shaken the post-Cold War global security consensus, imperiled the world supply of key crops, and raised worries it could set off a nuclear accident.
Biden reiterated accusations that Putin is considering resorting to using chemical or biologic weapons, though Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US has seen no evidence to suggest that such an escalation is imminent.
A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Ukrainian resistance has brought much of Russia's advance to a halt but has not sent Moscow's forces into retreat.
Facing unexpectedly stiff resistance that has left the bulk of Moscow's ground forces miles from the center of Kyiv, Putins troops are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraines cities and civilians.
Theres no connection with the world. We couldnt ask for help," said Julia Krytska, who was helped by volunteers to make it out with her husband and son. "People dont even have water there.
The warnings came as attacks continued in and around Kyiv and Mariupol, and people escaped the battered and besieged port city.

They bombed us for the past 20 days," said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who fled into Poland. During the last five days the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere  on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.
