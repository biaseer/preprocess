CIA Director William Burns said on Monday that Russian military forces could act in a very sweeping way but U.S. intelligence agencies have yet to conclude decisively that Moscow will invade Ukraine.
We dont know that Putin has made up his mind to use force, he added. But what we do know is that hes putting the Russian military, Russian security services in a place where they could act in a very sweeping way.
During the call, Biden is expected to highlight that the U.S. is prepared to impose harsh economic consequences on Moscow should it invade Ukraine.
Burns told the Journal that the meeting would be an opportunity to reinforce, re-emphasize the costs of the use of force.
Theres no need to expect any breakthroughs from this conversation. It is a working conversation at a very difficult period, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskovsaidof the upcoming call to reporters.
Last week, U.S. intelligence obtained by The Washington Postsaid that Russia is planning a military offensive against Ukraine that would involve about 175,000 troops along the border and could take place as early as next year.
While Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Biden are scheduled to speak via video conference on Tuesday, the Kremlin has said they do not expect any breakthroughs.
Roughly 90,000 Russian troops have gathered near the Ukrainian border, causing concerns of a potential invasion in Ukraine and among its Western allies.
I would never underestimate President Putins risk appetite on Ukraine, Burns said at The Wall Street Journals CEO Council Summit.
