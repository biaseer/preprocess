But again, weve said it and we still believe it today that there is still a time and a space for a diplomatic path forward, he added. We still believe that theres a way to de-escalate the tensions here find a peaceful way out of this so that a war in Ukraine can be averted.
Pentagon press secretaryJohn Kirbysaid on Sunday that time is shrinking when it comes to finding a diplomatic resolution to the Russian militarybuildup at the Ukrainian border, as U.S. officials warn that an invasion could come within days.
In light of the looming threat of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple countries including Sweden, Denmark and the U.S. have urged their citizens in Ukraine to leave the country. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week that the U.S. would not be sending in troops to evacuate Americans if Russia invades Ukraine, saying they should leave now.
Kirby reiteratedthat pointon Sunday, telling Fox News Channel anchor Sandra Smith, Now is not the time to be in Ukraine. You should make plans to leave immediately.
While appearing on Fox News Sunday, Kirby was asked if recent diplomatic efforts by European allies were a last-ditch effort to find a solution to Russian aggression.
Abundance of caution, safety and security of our personnel his paramount concern. We remain committed to our relationship with the Ukrainian armed forces,Kirby said at the time.
On Saturday, Kirby announced that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered 160 U.S. troops to be repositioned in Europe following a phone call withthe Pentagon chiefs Russian counterpart, Sergey Shoygu.
I dont know if I say last-ditch, but certainly we recognize the time component here seems to be shrinking. And that gives us all cause for concern, Kirby said.
