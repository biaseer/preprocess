One of theKremlin navys Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates in the White Sea launched the Zircon cruise missile, which hit a practice target 215 nautical miles away, according to Russias Defense Ministry, first reported byThe Associated Press.
U.S. and NATO intelligence have shown Russian forces could soon push into Ukraine, much like it did with its2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.
Russias military announced on Monday that it had successfully test-fired a hypersonic missile it developed.
The test only adds to tensions between the Kremlin and the West, as it comes amida major Russian military buildup near its border with Ukraine.
The Zircon, which is set to enter service next year on Russian ships and submarines, is meant to fly at a distance of up to 620 miles and at nine times the speed of sound, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin has stressed that the new missile, which Russia has tested several times as of late, will greatly increase Russian military capability.
Since that land grab, Moscow has made modernizing its armaments a top priority.The country has been developing several hypersonic missiles, including the Zircon.
