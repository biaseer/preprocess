The company clarified after the initial rule change was reported in the press that the exception only applied for people in Ukraine talking about the Russian military.
A Russian court Monday determined that Meta, the newly formed parent company of Facebook,was engaging in extremist activities,according toRussian state-owned media.
Russia earlier this month passed a law criminalizing what the government deems fake news, including describing the invasion of Ukraine as such.
Regulators blocked access to Facebook and Instagram earlier this month, although Russian citizens have continued to use the platform through VPNs.
The Russian case against Meta partially stems the companys decision to allow some calls of violence against soldiers invading Ukraine and the leaders of Russia and Belarus.
The designation means that Facebook and Instagram, which also falls under umbrella of Meta, will continue to be blocked in the country. The designation may also mean that all commercial activity and display of symbols associated with the brand could end up outlawed.
The messaging app WhatsApp, which is hugely popular in Russia, is excluded from the decision despite also being owned by Meta.
