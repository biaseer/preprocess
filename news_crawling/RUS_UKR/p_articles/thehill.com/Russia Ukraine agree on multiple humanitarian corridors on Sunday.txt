Russia and Ukraine have agreed onmultiple humanitarian corridors that will allow individuals to evacuate Ukraine on Sunday amid Russias invasion.
The humanitarian corridors will allow individuals in the southern besieged city of Mariupol and the southeastern port city of Berdyansk to relocate to Zaporizhzhia, according to CNBC.
While Russia has seized a number of Ukrainian cities, including Mariupol, its efforts have stalled in a handful of areas because of strong opposition from Ukraine.
Russias invasion of Ukraine entered its second month last week with no signs of slowing down. The offensive began in late February after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine.
Evacuees leaving Mariupol must evacuate in personal cars, according to Bloomberg. In Berdyansk, however, buses will be available for individuals fleeing to Zaporizhzhia
Two rockets also hit a fuel depot, and two others slammed a military factory, according to Lvivs regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyy.
One day earlier, Ukraines deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said Kyiv and Moscow had agreed on establishing 10 humanitarian corridors to allow individuals to leave Ukraine on Saturday, Reuters reported.
In one of the latest blows to Ukraine, however, four Russian rockets struck the Ukrainian city of Lviv, wounding at least five people. The incident marked the largest attack on the city since the invasion began.
