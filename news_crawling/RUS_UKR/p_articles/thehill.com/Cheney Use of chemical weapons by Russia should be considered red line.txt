Cheney, during an appearance on NBCs Meet the Press, told host Chuck Todd that we, in the West, United States and NATO, need to stop telling the Russians what we wont do.
We need to be very clear that we are considering all options and use of chemical weapons is certainly something that would alter our calculation, she said.
Rep.Liz CheneyR-Wyo. on Sunday said that the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine should be considered a red line by the U.S. and NATO.
The Wyoming Republican added that its important that Russia knows that we will contemplate changing the calculation in terms of humanitarian challenges and the humanitarian devastation the Ukrainian people are facing.
The U.S. has warned that Russia may be making such claims to lay false pretexts for a potential attack by Moscow.
Cheneys statements come as the U.S. has grown increasing more concerned thatRussia may use chemical weapons in Ukraine.Russiaaccused the U.S. of housing biological weapons in Ukrainian territory earlier this month a statement the White House has rejected.
And they need to understand that if the brutality here increases, the United States will contemplate and consider every possible range of actions along with our NATO allies, she added.
She added Russian President Vladimir Putins actions so far have demonstrated that the Russian military is nowhere near as capable as the world perhaps thought it was and probably not as capable as Putin thought it was.
