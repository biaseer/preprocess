Kulebas statements comeas Russia and Belarus announced on Sundayan extension of joint military drills near Ukraine.
As of this moment Im convinced hes made the decision, he said. We have reason to believe that.
The foreign minister of Ukraine is calling onwestern nations to implement at least partial sanctions against Russia amid increased concerns that Moscow will invade its neighbor.
The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war. As soon as you trigger them, that deterrent is gone. And until the last minute, as long as we can try to bring a deterrent effect to this, were going to try to do that, he said during an appearance on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday.
President Joe Biden last week said he was convinced thatRussian PresidentVladimir Putinhas made up his mind to invade Ukraine.
Its time to act, he added. Im officially saying that there are all the grounds to implement at least a part of sanctions prepared against Russia, now.
Belarusian Defense MinisterViktor Khrenin said that military leaders from his country and Russia had decided to continue checkingjoint force readiness due to the aggravation of the situation in eastern Ukraine, where shelling near the contact line between Ukrainian soldiers and Russia-backed separatists led to thousands of people evacuating the area.
Russia has to be stopped right now. We see how events are unfolding, Dmytro Kuleba said on Sunday during a televised briefing from a security conference in Munich, according to Reuters.
Secretary of State Antony Blinkenlater defended the Bidens administrations decision not to place more sanctions on Russia ahead of a possible incursion by Moscow against Ukraine.
