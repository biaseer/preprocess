In January, a group of 40 House Democrats pressed party leadership to act on measures to lower drug prices, an important policy goal for the Democratic Party, especially during an election year.
As Reuters reported, 13 congressional lawmakerssigned a letter toStephen Ubl,president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America PhRMA, asking that his organization explain thetroubling price increases for brand name drugs last month.
A group of Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders Vt. on Tuesday called on the pharmaceutical industry to answer questions regarding the recent rise in drug prices.
In their letter, they citeda recentstudyfrom the University of Minnesota that found drugmakers increased prices for 72 percent of the 100 top-selling drugs in the U.S. in early 2022. Another study cited by the lawmakers, from Johns Hopkins University, found that prices for 16 out of the top 20 Medicare Part D drugs were higher in January.
