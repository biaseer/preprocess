Russias attack last night put Europes largest nuclear power at grave risk. It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe, she said at the time.
Thereport comes just one day after Russian forces attacked Ukraines largest nuclear facility,the news outlet noted.
U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsLinda Thomas-Greenfield told the U.N. Security Council that Russian troops were inching closer to Ukraines nuclear plant inYuzhnoukrainsk, according to Fox News.
Russian forces are now 20 miles, and closing, from Ukraines second-largest nuclear facility, she reportedly said. So this imminent danger continues.
Russia previously seized theZaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, forcing staffers there to work at gunpoint. Fighting also occurred nearUkraines decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant earlier in the week.
Earlier in the session, Thomas-Greenfield signaled that Russias focus on nuclear plants could pose a problem for Ukraine.
Thomas-Greenfield during the Friday emergency session warned that thenuclear power station in Yuzhnoukrainskwas in imminent danger.
Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict, Thomas-Greenfield said, Fox News reported. Reliable electricity is vital for the nuclear facility, as are back-up diesel generators and fuel. Safe transit corridors must be maintained. Russia must halt any further use of force that might put at further risk all 15 operable reactors across Ukraine  or interfere with Ukraines ability to maintain the safety and security of its 37 nuclear facilities and their surrounding populations.
