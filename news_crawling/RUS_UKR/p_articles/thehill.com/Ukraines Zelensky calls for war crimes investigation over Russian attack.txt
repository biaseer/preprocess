European Parliament members gave Zelensky a standing ovation onTuesday afterhe pleaded for help during remarks from Kyiv.
Along with the attack on Kharkiv, Russia has reportedly used cluster bombs against Ukraine, which are banned under an international treaty.
Nobody will forgive. Nobody will forget.  This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation, The Associated Press reported.
Russia has denied targeting civilians or committing war crimes duringits invasion of Ukraine, the AP noted.
Hiscall comes after an attack on Ukraines second-largest city,Kharkiv, that killed at least 10 people and wounded 35 others.
This is the price of freedom, Zelensky said, the BBC reported. This is terror against Ukraine. There were no military targets in the square  nor are they in those residential districts of Kharkiv which come under rocket artillery fire.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Russia to be investigated for war crimes on Tuesday.
U.S. intelligence reportedly says Ukrainian resistance to the invasion has been stronger than expected, as Russia has still not taken over the capital city of Kyiv.
