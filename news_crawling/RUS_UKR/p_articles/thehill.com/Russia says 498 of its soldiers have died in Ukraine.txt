A senior defense official said on Tuesday that the U.S. hasseen indications that morale is flagging in some of these units because of Ukrainian resistance and said Russian troops had not made much progress toward their advance to the Ukrainian capital.
That solidarity was especially on show on Tuesday before and during President Bidens first State of the Union speech, where Biden and a bipartisan group of lawmakers wore the Ukrainian colors of yellow and blue.
The Russian Ministry of Defense announced on Wednesday that498 of its soldiers had died in Ukraine.
Children, women and defence forces are losing their lives every hour,Ukraines emergency service said in a statement, according to Reuters.
That number, however, stands instark contrast to the figures cited by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Think of this number: almost 6,000 Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war, the Ukrainian president said. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible.
Russian officials reportedly acknowledged Sunday there had been casualties, but this was the countrys first time offering a specific number.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is reporting that more than 2,000 of its civilianshave died from the conflict.
The development comes roughly a week since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, which has since drawn criticism from the international community, quickly unifying people together to show solidarity for Ukraine.
During a video addresson Wednesday, Zelensky said that close to 6,000 Russian soldiers had died within six days.
The official said that the lack of progress between Monday and Tuesday toward Kyiv was due to fuel and logistics challenges, such as a food shortage.
