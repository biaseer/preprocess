President Biden said last week that he is convinced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade the former Soviet state, though Moscow has continued to deny these accusations. On Sunday, Biden agreed to meet with Putin in the coming days on the condition that Russia does not proceed with an invasion of Ukraine.
The U.S. has reportedly informed its allies of certain Ukrainian cities that could come under attack if a Russian invasion does occur.
The U.S. has informed allies that cities includingKharkiv in the north andOdessa and Kherson in the south could be targeted in a potential invasion, three people familiar toldBloomberg.
One official who spoke with the outlet said the United Statesview is being determined by the type of Russian forces currently gathered near Ukraine and what their capabilities are. Though the sources could not say what the potential attacks might include, one said that U.S. intelligence has suggested that a large-scale invasion would include air support and cyber disruptions.
Bloomberg has already published several articles about the alleged Russian invasion of Ukraine or non-invasion of Ukraine,Zakharova said to Bloomberg. This information has never proved accurate. It was denied both by the Russian side and refuted directly by subsequent events.
RussianForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova shot down Bloombergs report when reached for comment by the outlet.
Russia is believed to have amassed up to 190,000 soldiers along Ukraines border, including in the neighboring country of Belarus.
