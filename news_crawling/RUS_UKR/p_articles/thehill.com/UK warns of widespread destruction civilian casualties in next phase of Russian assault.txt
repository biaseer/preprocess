Over the past week Russian forces have made limited progress in capturing these cities instead, Russia has increased its indiscriminate shelling of urban areas resulting in widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties,officials said.
On Saturday, the United Nations estimated that nearly 900 Ukrainian civilians have died since Russias attack on Ukraine began, but said the number could be considerably higher.
In an update on the situation in Ukraine, the ministry said Russian forces have continued to encircle a number of cities across eastern Ukraine.
The Britishdefense ministry on Sunday warned that the Russian military will likely increase its assault on Ukraines urban areas in the next few weeks, resulting in civilian casualties.
It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at thecost of further civilian casualties, they added.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration, the U.N. human rights office said in a statement.
