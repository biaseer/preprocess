She is probably around the same age as the son of the woman he is accused of raping.
The first Russian soldier to be charged with using rape as a weapon of war in Ukraine has been revealed as a married father of two.
Pictures show that Romanov, 31, and wife Albina  whose hobby is baking  have a girl.
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova says the missing soldiermay still be fighting or on rotation in Russia or he may even be dead but 'he will not escape a fair trial'
Investigators say Romanov, a soldier of the 239th regiment of the 90th Guards Tank Vitebsk-Novgorod Division, broke into a house in a suburb of Kyiv in March and shot dead its owner, named as Andrey, 35.
The soldiers returned and raped her again 20 minutes later. They returned a third time but were so drunk they fell asleep, allowing her and her son to escape.
The drunken soldier, along with a comrade, raped his wife, 33, in an ordeal lasting several hours.
They threatened their victim's son, four, who was sobbing in the next-door room. She told The Times: 'All the time they held the gun to my head and taunted me, saying: 'Shall we kill her or keep her alive?'.'
Ukrainian prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said: 'Now we don't know where he is  maybe he is fighting still, maybe he is on rotation in Russia, maybe he is dead.'
Miss Venediktova said: 'Even though the accused is not in our hands yet, he will not escape a fair trial.'
Mikhail Romanov is due to be tried in his absence. He is accused of breaking into a house and murdering the homeowner before repeatedly attacking his wife.
