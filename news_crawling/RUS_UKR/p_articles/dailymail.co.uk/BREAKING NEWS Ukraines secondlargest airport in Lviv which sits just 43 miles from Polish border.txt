Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport was hit by the aerial bombardment in the early hours of Friday morning.
The attack comes just days after dozens of people were killed after more than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted a military facility just outside the city on Sunday.
Video footage shot from a distance showed fireballs erupting from the facility, which sits 43 miles east of the Polish border.
Lviv Gov. Maxim Kozitsky said in a statement that at least 35 people were killed in the attack and another 134 were wounded.
At least two fireballs were seen erupting from the airport, but it is currently unclear how many missiles struck and where they came from.
In a translation of the impassioned address, which was shared on social media, Volodymyr Zelensky said the'peaceful Vinnytsia just was bombed'.
The governor has yet to comment on the most recent attack, which is the westernmost assault conducted by Moscow.
Earlier in March, Ukraine's Vinnystiaairport was 'completely destroyed' by eight Russian missiles, the Ukrainian president confirmed in an address as he urged the West to send more aircraft.
Footage shared on social media showed a fireball erupting from Lviv Airport in Western Ukraine as it was shelled by Russia on Friday morning
