Family friend Julie Simkins has been helping to get the house ready through a Facebook group called Wrexham and Ukraine United.
He said: 'I wanted to help because it was absolutely devastating watching millions of people fleeing - the bombs going off'.
Maria, who worked in anaesthetics at a Ukrainian hospital, is still in western Ukraine but is making her way to a refugee camp in Poland.
Jamie, who started his telecoms company at 21, is now set to welcome a mother-of-three to the home.
The home is now set to house mum-of-three Maria and her boys, aged 10, 12 and 14.
He added: 'It would have taken about two years, been too cramped and lacking in privacy.
She added: 'They've been rallying round to help with donations and are ready to embrace her and the boys.'
