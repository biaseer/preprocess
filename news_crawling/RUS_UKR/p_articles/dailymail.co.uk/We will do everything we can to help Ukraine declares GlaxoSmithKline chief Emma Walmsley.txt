The division, which was named Haleon last week, owns brands including Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers.
We have just huge respect for the courage and resolve of the people of Ukraine, our people and the people beyond that, and want to do everything we can to help, Walmsley said.
The separation is expected to be the biggest demerger in Europe for 20 years and the largest London listing in a decade.
Despite market volatility caused by the war in Ukraine, Walmsley said that she was extremely confident that the separation of Haleon will be completed on time.
She added that the company would support and comply with all sanctions. It has two businesses in Kyiv, according to its annual report, but has no factories in Ukraine.
The boss of GlaxoSmithKline deplored the Russian invasion of Ukraine as the pharma giant revealed it was supporting relief efforts in the country.
The comments came as the group confirmed plans to complete the demerger of its consumer healthcare business in July this year.
The spinning out of Haleon is a key plank of her plans for the business.
Emma Walmsley said the FTSE 100 firm utterly condemned the invasion and was helping its 400 Ukrainian staff as well as humanitarian organisations such as Save the Children and the Red Cross.
