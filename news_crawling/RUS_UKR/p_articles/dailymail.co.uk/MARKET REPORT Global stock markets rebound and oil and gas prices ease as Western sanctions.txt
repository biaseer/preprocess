Cyber-security firm Darktrace soared 14.1 per cent, or 50.2p, to 407.2p as the incursion into Ukraine sparked fears that Western companies and governments could be hit by higher numbers of cyber-attacks from Russia, potentially increasing reliance on its services.
'Some of it is people looking to buy on the dip and taking the alleged advice by financier Nathan Rothschild that you should buy on the sound of cannons and sell on the sound of trumpets.'
