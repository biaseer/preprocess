UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the agreement would help ease the global food crisis somewhat. The two warring neighbours are among the worlds biggest exporters of food, but Russias invasion led to a de-facto blockade of the Black Sea, resulting in Ukraines exports dropping to a sixth of their pre-war level.
24Moscow, July 23: Russia and Ukraine have signed a deal to allow grain exports from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday.
The signing ceremony took place at Istanbuls lavish Dolmabahce Palace in the presence of Erdogan and Guterres, wherein Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu and Ukraines infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, signed the deal separately on Friday, carefully avoiding sitting at the same table and avoiding shaking hands.
Fridays deal means around $10bn worth of grain will be available for sale with roughly 20 million tonnes of last years harvest that can now be exported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. UNI
