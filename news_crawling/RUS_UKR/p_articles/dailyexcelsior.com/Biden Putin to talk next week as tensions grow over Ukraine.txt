What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be, will be, the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do, Biden said Friday.
Russia is more adamant than ever that the US guarantees that Ukraine will not be admitted to the NATO military alliance.
US intelligence officials, meanwhile, have determined that Russia has massed about 70,000 troops near its border with Ukraine and has begun planning for a possible invasion as soon as early next year, according to a Biden administration official who was not authorised to discuss that finding publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed plans on Saturday for the much-anticipated call and said it will take place in the evening.
MOSCOW, Dec 4: President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will speak by telephone on Tuesday as tensions between the US and Russia escalate over a Russian troop buildup on the Ukrainian border seen as a sign of a potential invasion.
US officials and former American diplomats say while the Russian president is clearly laying the groundwork for a possible invasion, Ukraines military is better armed and prepared today than in the past, and that sanctions threatened by the West would do serious damage to the Russian economy.
