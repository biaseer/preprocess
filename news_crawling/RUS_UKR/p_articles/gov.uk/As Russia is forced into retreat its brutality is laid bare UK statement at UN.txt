I will now make a statement in my capacity as the Representative of the United Kingdom.
The United Nations was created in the wake of a European war of aggression that laid waste to Europe and engulfed the world.
We have heard today, again, the devastating impact of Russias unilateral and illegal military action in Ukraine. Its impact on surrounding countries and the region, and on the security and prosperity of the wider world, as it seeks to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
And now, as Russia is forced into retreat from areas around Kyiv, the brutality of the invasion is laid bare. We have all seen the horrific images from the towns of Bucha and Irpin of civilians deliberately killed in areas from which Russian forces have recently withdrawn  and the video we saw earlier underlined that horror.
These acts, and other credible incidents, must be investigated as war crimes, and the UK fully supports the work of the International Criminal Court and the work of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and other national prosecutors.
Colleagues, as we, and so many others, have said so many times, all of this could be stopped if the Russian Federation ended this war now.
All of us who signed the UN Charter committed to ending the scourge of war, to fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person, the equal rights of nations large and small, to justice, and respect for international law.
