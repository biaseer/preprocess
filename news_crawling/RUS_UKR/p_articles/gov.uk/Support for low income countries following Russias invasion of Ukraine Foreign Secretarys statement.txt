Russias bombardment across Ukraine has brought exports from the worlds breadbasket almost entirely to a halt, leading to steep price rises and jeopardising livelihoods across the globe.
The UK and our partners have secured the largest ever World Bank financial commitment to low income countries around the world.
It will provide $170 billion over the next 15 months with $50 billion delivered by the end of June, supporting countries faced with economic hardship as a result of Russias invasion of Ukraine.
The Foreign Secretary called on the World Bank and others to commit to additional support for Ukraine, its neighbours and developing countries in response to Russias invasion. Read the Foreign Secretarys full statement at the World Banks Spring Meetings Development Committee.
Despite Russias refusal to take responsibility for its actions, the UK and World Bank partners this week have delivered for the people of Ukraine and for the wider world.
