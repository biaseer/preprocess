By voting in favour of convening an emergency special session of the General Assembly on Ukraine tomorrow, the members of this Council have laid bare Russias diplomatic impotence.
As each day passes in this unprovoked and unjustified war, support for the Ukrainian people and their fight for freedom grows.
But Russia cannot stop the world from coming together to condemn its invasion of Ukraine.
We urge all Members of the United Nations to use their voice tomorrow to call for the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine and an end to this war.
