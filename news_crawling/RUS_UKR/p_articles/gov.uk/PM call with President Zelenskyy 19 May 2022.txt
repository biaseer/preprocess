The Prime Minister closed by congratulating President Zelenskyy on the occasion of Vyshyvanka Day and reiterating the United Kingdoms steadfast solidarity with the people of Ukraine.
The Prime Minister spoke to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy today to discuss a range of issues, including military support and global food security.
President Zelenskyy updated on the situation in the Donbas and the ongoing fight to regain all of Ukraines sovereign territory and counter Russian disinformation in contested areas. The Prime Minister stressed his undimmed admiration for the brave defenders of Mariupol and urged Russia to treat any prisoners of war with dignity and respect.
The leaders discussed progress in negotiations and agreed to step up work with allies, including the US, France and Germany, to define the longer-term security architecture for Ukraine.
Noting the recent announcement of an additional 1.3billion in UK military aid for Ukraine, the Prime Minister set out the support flowing to Ukraines defence, including long-range artillery, shore-to-ship missiles and unmanned drones.
The Prime Minister raised his significant concerns about the growing global fallout from Russias illegal invasion and President Putins craven and reckless blockade of Ukraines Black Sea ports, including rising food prices in developing countries. They looked at options to open up critical sea and land supply routes for Ukrainian grain stocks, and committed to direct their teams to work urgently on the next steps.
