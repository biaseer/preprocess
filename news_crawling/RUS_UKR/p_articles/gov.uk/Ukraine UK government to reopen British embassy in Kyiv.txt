The embassy was forced to temporarily close due to Russias full-scale and illegal invasion. A contingent of British staff remained in western Ukraine to provide humanitarian and other support.
I want to pay tribute to the bravery and resilience of the embassy team and their work throughout this period.
Contact the FCDO Communication Team via email monitored 24 hours a day in the first instance, and we will respond as soon as possible.
The Prime Minister has today confirmed the embassy is set to re-open next week, dependent on the security situation.
The extraordinary fortitude and success of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people in resisting Russian forces, means we will shortly be re-opening our British Embassy in Kyiv.
The British embassy premises are currently being made secure before staff return, starting with the UK Ambassador Melinda Simmons.
