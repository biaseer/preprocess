BRICS has supported the NDBs goals of attaining the highest possible credit rating and institutional development. The BRICS member nations have also stressed that they have a similar approach to the global economic governance, and their mutual cooperation can make a valuable contribution to the post-Covid economic recovery.
We support talks between Russia and Ukraine. We have also discussed our concerns over the humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine, the joint declaration said.
BRICS members vowed to widen the Shanghai-based New Development Bank NDB on Thursday, following the successful admission of Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates UAE and Uruguay in September 2021.
Amid border tensions between India and China, the leaders committed to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, stressing the peaceful resolution of differences and disputes through dialogue and consultation.
The BRICS countries - which represent 24 percent of the global GDP and 16 percent of worldwide trade - further reiterated the need to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue through peaceful and diplomatic means as per international law. They stressed the importance of preserving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a deal reached between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council in 2015. The stand-off between Iran and western nations continues following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018.
Leaders also discussed the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe, recalling their national positions at different global forums, including the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly.
