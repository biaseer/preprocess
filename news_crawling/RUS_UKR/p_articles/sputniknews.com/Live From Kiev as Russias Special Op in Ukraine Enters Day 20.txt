The delegations from the two countries are scheduled to resume their peace negotiations on Tuesday.
Russia started a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in response to calls from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics for protection against intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops - days after Moscow formally recognised the independence of the Donbass republics. The Russian Defence Ministry said the special operation is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure and the civilian population is not in danger.
