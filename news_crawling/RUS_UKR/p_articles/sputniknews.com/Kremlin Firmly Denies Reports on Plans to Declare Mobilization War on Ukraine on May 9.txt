During a briefing, Peskov was asked whether reports in Western media about Moscow declaring a mobilization on May 9 are true.
On Wednesday, CNN, citing Western experts and politicians, reported that Vladimir Putin may declare war on Ukraine on Victory Day, May 9, which would allow for a general mobilization of the population. A declaration of war on Victory Day could bolster popular support for the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, CNN claimed.
Moscow launched a special military operation in Ukraine on February 24 after the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics appealed for help in fending off Ukrainian provocations. Western countries have since been pressuring Russia with sanctions and waging information warfare against Moscow.
