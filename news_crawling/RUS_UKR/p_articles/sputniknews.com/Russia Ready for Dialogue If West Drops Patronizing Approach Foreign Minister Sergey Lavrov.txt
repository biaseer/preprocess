Tensions between Russia and the West have been simmering since 2014, when a conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine and Crimea rejoined with Russia. Neither Kiev nor Western countries recognized the legitimacy of the reunification, accusing Russia of meddling in Ukraine's affairs. Moscow has repeatedly denied any interference, and insisted that the Crimean referendum was in line with international law.
The Russian foreign policy course is based on strong public support for steps toward strengthening sovereignty and maintaining neighborly and positive relations with "all those who are prepared to do this honestly and on an equal basis", the Foreign Minister said.
