The Ukrainian government and its Western allies accused Russia in spring of amassing troops on the Ukrainian border. Russia denied the claim and attributed troop movement to snap military drills. The Russian defence minister ordered forces back to their permanent bases by May.
The diplomat added that Ukraine still wanted the extra money "to not to be late" in responding to aggression.
"It was a contingency package in the event of further escalation. It was unrelated to regular military aid that the US has been providing to Ukraine as planned," Kuleba told the Ukrainian news website Liga.net.
Politico reported shortly after the US-Russia summit that the White House had frozen an aid package to Ukraine worth up to $100 million. The news website said the aid, which would have included lethal weapons, was contingent on Russia "crossing territorial red lines."
