This is not not the first terror attack the FSB has foiled this month: two weeks ago, the agency foiled a Ukraine-linked plot targeting an oil pipeline in Volgograd Region. Two neo-Nazis coordinated by the Ukrainian security services were eliminated during the operation.
The FSB noted that the suspect, who had a stash of Azov insignias and Ukrainian propaganda material, planned to flee the country following the attack.
On Thursday, the FSB published a video showing agents detain a man who had intended to carry out a terror attack in Kaliningrad, Russia.
According to the authorities, the suspect confessed to his plans, and the investigators discovered a stash with an IED with the explosive power of five kilograms 11 pounds of TNT.
