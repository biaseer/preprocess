In the statement, Biden called Russia's newly-launched special military operation on Ukraine "unprovoked and unjustified".
Earlier on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that a meeting between Biden and Putin was not currently being considered.
Russia remains the only member nation of the United Nations to recognise the DPR and LPR. The two breakaway states have been in conflict with Ukraine since declaring their independence in 2014.
Biden said that he will monitor the situation through the night before meeting with his G7 counterparts in the morning before addressing the American public and the world over further actions.
The response comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a special military operation in the Donbass to protect the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic from Kiev forces. The manoeuvre has been described as a peacekeeping mission by Russia, and an invasion by Ukraine and the United States and its NATO allies.
The European Union and the United States have already issued sweeping economic sanctions against Russia and Russian individuals and entities. The US said it would not send troops to Ukraine and engage in a war with Russia.
With sanctions already in place and war off the table, it remains to be seen what "further consequences" are at Biden's disposal.
