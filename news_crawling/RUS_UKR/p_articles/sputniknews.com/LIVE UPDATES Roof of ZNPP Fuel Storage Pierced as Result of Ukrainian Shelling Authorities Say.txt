Ukraine has shelled the territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics every day since the beginning of Moscows operation, targeting not only military and industrial facilities, but also residential areas and infrastructure.
On Sunday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Zaporozhye plant had been shelled again by Ukrainian forces.
The Russian army and the allied militia groups of the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk are advancing in Donbass and on Ukrainian territory.
Since early March, the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant has been under the control of the Russian armed forces.
