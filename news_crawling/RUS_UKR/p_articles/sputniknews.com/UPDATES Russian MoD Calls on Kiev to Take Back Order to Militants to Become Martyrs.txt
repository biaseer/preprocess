Over the past three days, Russian troops have helped to evacuate 59,304 people, including 139 foreign citizens, from the besieged city to Russia, the head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, Mikhail Mizintsev, said on Sunday.
On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine responding to calls for help from the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk in defending themselves against aggression by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the operation is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure.
