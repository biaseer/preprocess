The journalist further praised the success of an open letter from the German elites to Chancellor Scholz recently publishedin EMMA.
Prominent German journalist and founder of the feminist magazine EMMA, Alice Schwarzer, has lambasted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's invitation to Chancellor Olaf Scholz to visit Kiev, calling it an "unparalleled provocation".
The letter, signed by writer Martin Walser, filmmaker Gerhard Polt, writer and former judge Juli Zeh and members of the German academic community, called on the chancellor to reconsider his promise to send heavy weapons to Ukraine to help it fight Russia and the Donbass forces.
The 9 May invitation coincides with Russias annual celebration of victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. This year's celebration come amid Russia's military operation to de-Nazify and demilitarise Ukraine.
The Kremlin has repeatedly advised western countries against sending weapons to Ukraine, saying that it only perpetuates the conflict and delays the inevitable end of the special military operation launched on 24 February. Moscow has also warned that convoys with military equipment will be targets once they reach Ukrainian land.
Schwarzer argued that the letter opened a positive debate in her country regarding the pros and cons of arming the Ukrainian military.
Upon presenting her latest documentary in Munich, Schwarzer condemned Zelensky's provocative behaviour and expressed hope that Ukraine would change its tone. She also stressed that despite condemning certain aspects of Kiev's policy, she still supports Ukraine and its people.
