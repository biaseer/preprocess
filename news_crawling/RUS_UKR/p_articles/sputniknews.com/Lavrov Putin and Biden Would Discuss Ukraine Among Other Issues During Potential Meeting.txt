In turn, Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that reports warning about Russia's alleged preparations for invasion in Ukraine were "alarmist". Vladimir Putin has also pointed out the provocative nature of the recent exercises conducted by the United States and a number of its allies in the Black Sea.
Western media has repeatedly reported on the alleged Russian military build-up since late last month, saying it started after Russia had completed large-scale joint military exercises with Belarus Zapad-2021. Russia has firmly denied all accusations.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that at a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and American leader Joe Biden, Ukraine will also be addressed.
