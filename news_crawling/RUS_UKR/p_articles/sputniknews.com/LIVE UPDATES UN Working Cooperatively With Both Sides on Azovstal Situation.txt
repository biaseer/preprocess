Meanwhile, Russian military and Donbass militia troops continue to drive Ukrainian forces out of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic, which were recognised as independent states by Moscow in late February. They recently retook the Donetsk port city of Mariupol, blockading the remaining Ukrainian paramilitaries within the Azovstal steel plant.
The situation in Russia on the Ukrainian border remains tense. Overnight, an air defence system was used in the Kursk region, according to governor Roman Starovoyt. This occurred just a few days after two Ukrainian drones were downed in the region.
