Russian troops and Donbass militias continue advancing amid the special operation in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the joint forces liberated the city of Lisichansk, pushing Kiev's troops out of  the Lugansk People's Republic, which Russia and several other countries recognized earlier this year.
Moscow launched the special op on February 24 in response to attacks perpetrated by Kiev against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. Russia noted that its goal was to stop the eight-year-long war, perpetrated by Kiev against Donbass.
