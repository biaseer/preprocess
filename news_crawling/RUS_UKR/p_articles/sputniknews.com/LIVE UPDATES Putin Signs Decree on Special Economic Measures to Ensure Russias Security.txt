Earlier in the day, Moscow announced a ceasefire from 10:00 Moscow time 07:00 GMT so that civilians from a number of Ukrainian cities, including Kiev, could be evacuated.
Prior to that, Volodymyr Zelensky said that he had cooled off on the issue of joining NATO, as he realised that the alliance was not ready to accept Ukraine due to fears of a confrontation with Russia.
Ukraine needs security guarantees, as NATO isn't ready to grant Kiev membership in the alliance, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office and a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mikhail Podolyak, said on Tuesday.
