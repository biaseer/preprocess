Over the past month, Russian forces have been using Iskander missiles to eliminate Ukrainian command posts, fuel and weapons storage, missile defences, and other military objects.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has published a vide demonstrating Iskander ballistic missile systems in action during the special operation in Ukraine. The footage shows an operator launching the missile, as it flies off to hit its target, leaving a fiery trail of smoke in its wake.
