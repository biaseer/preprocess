We will make all-out efforts to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an immediate ceasefire. The message of the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was also conveyed to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian. The talks between Russia and Ukraine should put an end to the war between the two countries, Khatibzadeh was quoted as saying by the Iranian Republic Information Agency.
Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, after the Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples Republics DPR and LPR appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. Russia said that the aim of its special operation is to demilitarize and "denazify" Ukraine.
On Sunday, Amirabdollahian urged both Moscow and Kiev to find a political solution to the crisis and establish a ceasefire regime in a conflict zone.
