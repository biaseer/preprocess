Russia's concerns about the corridor for exports of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea must be taken into account, the source said, adding that the deal should benefit all sides.
On June 30, Russian Defense Ministry said that Russia had withdrawn its troops from the Zmeiny Snake island in the Odessa region as a gesture of goodwill. The ministry noted that in doing so Russia demonstrates that it does not hinder the efforts of the UN to create a humanitarian corridor for the export of agricultural products from Ukraine.
Ukraine and Russia account for an estimated 30 of global exports of wheat, 20 of maize and 76 of sunflower.
The UN has repeatedly warned that grain supply shortages could lead to a global food crisis. The West accused Russia of blocking Ukrainian grain exports to the global market. Moscow insists that the ports were mined by Ukraine, making shipments impossible. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia does not prevent the export of grain from Ukraine, and if Kiev demines the ports, ships with grain will be able to leave unhindered.
