Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Indiawhich is currently a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Councilhas drawn scrutiny for having abstained multiple times on votes in the Security Council, U.N. General Assembly and U.N. Human Rights Council on resolutions criticizing the Russian aggression. Instead, theIndian Mission at the United Nations issued a nuanced statementcalling for an immediate cessation of violence in Ukraine, without publicly condemning Russias actionsa move that pleased neither its Western partners nor Russia.
Although the Biden administration hasavoided any public criticism of Indias stance over Ukraine, its disappointment over New Delhis repeated failure to condemn President Vladimir Putins actions is palpable. American officials have identified India as a reliable U.S. partner in Washingtons Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China, and they clearly expected more from India in view of their emerging strategic alignment.
The Russian-Ukraine war puts India in a difficult position. On the one hand, India wants to avoid antagonizing the U.S., a long-time partner with which it has multifaceted and deepening ties. On the other, ongoing tensions with Pakistan and China require India to preserve its relationship with Russia, which is one of New Delhis leading suppliers of weapons and defense equipment.
