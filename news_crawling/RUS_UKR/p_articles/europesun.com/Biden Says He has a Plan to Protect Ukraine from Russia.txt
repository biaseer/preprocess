The situation at Ukraine's eastern border has raised fears Moscow is planning to invade its neighbor. Russian aggression was the focus this week of a NATO foreign ministers meeting, with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warning Russia any escalation of the situation would come at a high price.
U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Friday he has been developing a set of initiatives that will make it "very, very difficult" for Russia to escalate the situation at its border with Ukraine, where Moscow has been building up troops and equipment for weeks.
Diplomatic efforts have been underway to ease tensions in the region this week. Blinken met in Stockholm on Thursday with both Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Biden said his administration is 'putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Russian President Vladimir Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do. But that's in play right now.'
When asked about the situation during remarks Friday at the White House, Biden told reporters he has been in constant contact with U.S. allies in Europe, and with Ukraine. He said Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan have been engaged extensively.
Earlier Friday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Russia has now massed more than 94,000 troops near Ukraine's border, suggesting to him they could be preparing for a large-scale military offensive at the end of January.
The Kremlin said Friday arrangements are also being made for a video call between Biden and Putin in the coming days.
