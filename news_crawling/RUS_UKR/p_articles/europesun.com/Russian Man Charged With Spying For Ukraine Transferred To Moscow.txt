Russia's Federal Security Service FSB said then that its officers had detained a person who 'passed classified information about Russia's Black Sea Fleet to Ukrainian military intelligence.'
A Russian national detained in April in Ukraine's Russia-annexed Crimean Peninsula on espionage charges has been transferred to Moscow.
According to the court, Petrushin was arrested on April 21 in the Crimean city of Sevastopol.
The Moscow Lefortovo district court on June 21 said that Yevgeny Petrushin's pretrial detention had been extended until September 20 after he was transferred from Crimea to the Russian capital last week.
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March 2014, sending in troops and staging a referendum denounced as illegitimate by at least 100 countries after Moscow-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted amid a wave of public protests.

Since then, Russia has arrested dozens of people in Crimea on charges including extremism, terrorism, and espionage.
Rights groups have said that after imposing its control over the peninsula, Moscow aggressively moved to prosecute Ukrainian activists and anyone who questions the annexation.
Russia also backs separatists in a war against Ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 13,200 people in eastern Ukraine since April 2014.
The Lenin district court in the city of Sevastopol said on April 22 that 'a Russian citizen born in 1998' suspected of high treason had been placed under pretrial arrest until at least June 19. The name of the suspect was not disclosed at the time.
