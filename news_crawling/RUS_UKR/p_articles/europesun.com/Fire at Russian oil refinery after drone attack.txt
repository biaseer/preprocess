A fire broke out at an oil refinery in southern Russia's Rostov Region on Wednesday after it was hit by a Ukrainian drone.
Unconfirmed footage uploaded on social media captured a UAV approaching the oil facility and smashing into it at full speed. The impact led to a large explosion, with the blaze starting immediately.
The fire may have been the result of a drone attack on the refinery's technical installations, Rostov Region Governor Vasily Golubev has said.
The refinery is located some 10km from the border with the People's Republic of Lugansk.
The strikes, targeting infrastructure including oil facilities and also residential areas, have resulted in destruction, injuries, and several civilian deaths.
"The debris from two UAVs has been discovered at the plant," Golubev wrote on Telegram.
The quality of footage is low, making it difficult to confirm the type of aircraft.
The blaze occurred at the Novoshakhtinsky oil refinery, affecting an area of around 50 square meters, and was quickly put out, the emergency services said. There were no injuries or fatalities, they added.
Ukraine's military has carried out numerous attacks within southern Russia, mainly in the Belgorod and Bryansk Regions, since Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February.
