Last month, the US State Department threatened a "swift and decisive response" if an invasion is launched via Belarus.
"Our defense system is built in such a way that no one can reach Kiev," he continued.
"I honestly and frankly say, I do not believe in this scenario," Reznikov stressed. "Don't forget that we have a thousand kilometers of border with Belarus, of which about 750 kilometers is marshes, brushwood, very difficult terrain. Not every place is easy to cross."
A Russian invasion of Ukraine via Belarusian territory is an impossibility due to several geographical factors, the Ukrainian defense minister claimed on Monday, contradicting a scenario proposed by the US last month.
Speaking to ICTV, Aleksey Reznikov stated that the American theory, first floated by State Department spokesman Ned Price, would be too complex for the Russian military to pull off. Price suggested that troops could enter Kiev in just a couple of days by coming across the border with Belarus rather than invading directly from Russia.
According to Reznikov, the easiest section to cross is closer to the frontier with Poland, and a significant distance away from Kiev. The defense minister also noted that his Belarusian counterpart, Viktor Khrenin, had already assured him that "there will be no aggressive actions" on behalf of Minsk.
Russian troops are currently in Belarus for the Union Resolve 2022 exercises, which will be coming to an end on February 20. According to NATO, Moscow dispatched 30,000 soldiers for the drills, who are due to be sent home at the weekend.
