Regarding the extent of German aid to Ukraine, 43 said they are content with the current state of assistance, while 26 want Berlin to do more and a quarter believe the country is already doing too much in this respect.
Although some politicians from the ruling 'traffic-light' coalition are calling for continued deliveries of heavy weaponry to Ukraine, even at the expense of Germany's own military, 62 of the respondents expressed skepticism about whether this would be a prudent move, while only 32 would welcome such deliveries.
According to the survey, some 77 of Germans believe that the West should make concrete efforts to try to launch negotiations with Russia, which could help bring an end to the conflict in Ukraine. Only 17 would oppose such talks. When asked whether it is the right thing for Western leaders to keep phoning Russian President Vladimir Putin, 87 of the respondents replied in the affirmative, with 11 against.
The latter sentiment is particularly prevalent in eastern Germany and among supporters of the Alternative for Germany party, the researchers noted.
The majority of Germans want the West to take concrete steps to initiate talks with Russia to end the Ukraine conflict, a recent survey has indicated.
Published on Wednesday, the poll commissioned by Germany's RTLntv-Trendbarometer was conducted from August 26 through August 29, with 1,011 people taking part.
