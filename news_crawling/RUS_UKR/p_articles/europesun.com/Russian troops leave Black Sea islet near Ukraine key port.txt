Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusation, criticizing Kiev for failing to clear the Black Sea coastline, including the harbor waters.
MOSCOW, June 30 Xinhua -- The Russian armed forces completed their tasks and withdrew from the tiny Snake Island in the Black Sea south of Ukraine's important port city of Odessa on Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced.
In a goodwill gesture, Russia has demonstrated to the international society that there is no obstacle for the United Nations to establish a humanitarian corridor to transport agricultural products from Ukraine, the ministry said in a statement.
Ukraine and some Western countries blame Moscow for the global food shortage, alleging that the Russian forces have impeded the export of Ukrainian grain.
