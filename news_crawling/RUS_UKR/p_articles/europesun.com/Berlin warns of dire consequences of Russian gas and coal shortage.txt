"Unfortunately, it cannot be excluded that we will have to make decisions that will have dire consequences for businesses, jobs and supply chains in entire regions," RT website quoted Muller as saying on Wednesday.
In the sane context, a report issued by the German Economy Ministry warned that Germany will have to stop operating some of its power plants if it ends coal imports from Russia.
Berlin, SANA- Head of the Federal Agency for German Energy Networks, Klaus Muller, has warned that the acute gas shortage caused by the events in Ukraine will have serious consequences for the German population.
"An immediate ban on coal imports from Russia will lead to a coal shortage after a few weeks," the ministry said in its report.
