Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of the address that Zelenska would be speaking on behalf of all Ukrainian mothers and women.
President Joe Biden presented the Ukrainian first lady with a bouquet of flowers - yellow sunflowers, blue hydrangeas and white orchids - the colors of Ukraine's flag.
The White House said Zelenska is visiting Washington "to highlight the human cost of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. They will discuss the United States' continued support for the government of Ukraine and its people as they defend their democracy and cope with the significant human impacts of Russia's war, which will be felt for years to come."
The two last saw each other during Biden's unannounced visit to western Ukraine in May when they visited a school and joined children who were making Mother's Day gifts.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi encouraged all members of the House and Senate to attend, saying it would be an "important and timely opportunity to hear directly from First Lady Zelenska, to learn more about the terrible toll of the Russian invasion and to express our gratitude to the people of Ukraine for their fight for Democracy."
"And I really believe that it will be heard by those on whom decision-making in the U.S. depends," the president said.
U.S. lawmakers are set to hear Wednesday from Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska as she delivers remarks on Capitol Hill.
