Moscow has said that its Kalibr cruise missiles struck a missile factory outside Kiev and promised more strikes on the Ukrainian capital should Ukraine continue its attacks on Russian territory.
Russia earlier accused Ukraine of shelling its Belgorod and Bryansk regions on Thursday, leaving seven residents injured, including a two-year-old boy and his pregnant mother.
