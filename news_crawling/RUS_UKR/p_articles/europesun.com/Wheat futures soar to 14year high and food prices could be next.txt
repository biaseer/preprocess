Wheat futures were up 7.62, at $10.59 per bushel - the highest since 2008. Corn and soybean oil futures prices also surged. May corn futures were up 0.7, at $7.31 a bushel, after touching levels not seen since 2013.
Despite an attempt to resume negotiations, fighting has continued between Russian and Ukrainian troops. As a result, the Black Sea ports used by both countries to export grain have been avoided by international shippers.
Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat, accounting for over 18 of international exports. Together with Ukraine, which has also stopped shipping grain, the two countries supply about 30 of global wheat supplies. The crisis threatens to push food prices across the world to an all-time high.
Global prices for wheat reached new multi-year highs on Thursday, as warring tensions between major exporters Russia and Ukraine continued to raise concerns about the global supply of the commodity.
