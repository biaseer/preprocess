Left bloodied, Shufrych stood up to fight back and the two fell to the ground in a violent scrap before Butusov put his opponent in a headlock.
THIS is the shocking moment a mass brawl erupted during a live Ukrainian TV debate over Vladimir Putin.
It came as Boris Johnson warned that Russia is planning the "biggest war in Europe since 1945" as Putin intends to "invade and encircle Kyiv."

Butusov was filmed as he walked up to his fellow guest and hit him in the face, as former PM Arseniy Yatsenyuk and ex-president Petro Poroshenko watched on.
