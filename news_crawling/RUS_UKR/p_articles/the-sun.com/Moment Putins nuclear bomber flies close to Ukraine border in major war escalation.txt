Larger Tu-95s have been used a number of timesto strike targets in Ukraine with non-nuclear weapons, notably Kh-55 and Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles.
The super-loud Tu-95 is the only propeller-powered strategic bomber still in operational use today, and the plane first flew 70 years ago.
Putin has deployed the Tu-95s to buzz Britain at moments of high tension, for example in February this year when the Royal Air Forcescrambled Typhoon fighters to escort two Bears off northern Scotland.
More footage emerged showing a mission by the Tu-95s on Saturday over Smolensk region, also in western Russia.
THIS is the chilling moment one of Vladimir Putin's nuclear bombers was caught flying close to the Ukrainian border in a major military escalation.
The TU-160 strategic bomber was seen in the skies over Western Russia amid huge pressure on the Kremlin over the sinking of the Moskva flagship in the Black Sea.
Videos today caught four aircraft - one used to carry nuclear bombs - over Kaluga region, between Moscow and the Ukrainian border.
