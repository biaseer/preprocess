Svitlana Saseyi, a Ukrainian community leader and the main organiser of the event explained,  Sadly, this year's date also symbolically marks six months to the day from the tragic beginning of the full invasion by Russia. This day is marked by a strong sense of patriotism for the country. It honours the people and their freedom. It is also a day to remember those who fought for our identity and lost their lives for our nation
This Wednesday August 24 is Independence Day in Ukraine and the local Ukrainian community in Kilkenny will mark the occasion with a celebration at the Parade.
Everyone is welcome to attend the event, which will take place from 5pm to 6pm. There will be music, dance, singing and speeches and displays of Ukrainian culture.
The Day of Independence will assert the connection of Ukrainians living now with many generations of our people. The state-building experience of Ukrainians, our culture, and Ukrainian character are more than a thousand years old, she added.
