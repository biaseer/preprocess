These suspensions will remain in effect until further notice, according to a statement from the N.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission.
Ending the sale of Russian-made goods is meant to impose economic consequences on the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin, although economists have said the prohibition of Russian vodka sales wont have much of an impact on the countrys economy because most vodka in the U.S. isnt Russian-made.
But if youre a vodka fan, you dont have to give it up completely to show solidarity with Ukraine. Many popular brands are not based in Russia, including Absolut Vodka Swedish, Grey Goose French and Smirnoff American.
In his executive order, Cooper said Russia has  inflicted and will continue to inflict significant harm and suffering on the people of Ukraine.
The brand said in a statement that Stoli vodka brands and its owner Yuri Shefler were exiled from Russia nearly two decades ago.
Still, the state agency that governs liquor sales in North Carolina has said it will be suspending the sale of some Russian-made products in accordance with an executive order from Gov. Roy Cooper.
CHARLOTTE  Many bars, restaurants and liquor stores in North Carolina are pledging to stop selling Russian-made alcohol because of the invasion of Ukraine.
That move came shortly after Cooper issued an executive order in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine calling on state entities to review all existing contracts and operations to determine whether they directly benefit any Russian entities and take all reasonable steps to terminate that contract or operation.
North Carolinas decision is also meant to show solidarity with Ukrainian people who live in the state.
