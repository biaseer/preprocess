According to the Kremlin, Belarusian ruler Alexander Lukashenko is ready to create the conditions for a meeting between Russian and Ukrainian delegations.

In response to Zelenskyys proposal, Vladimir Putin is ready to send a delegation at the level of representatives of Defence Ministry, Foreign Ministry, and presidential administration to Minsk for negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.
