Kyiv and Moscow have blamed each other for the incident, with the Ukrainian side saying it was a deliberate Russian bombing.
More than 1,000 people were sheltering in the theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol believed to have been the target of a Russian bombing.
Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that people had sought protection from shelling in the building and it was now destroyed.
Russia is blaming the Ukrainian nationalist Azov regiment for the attack. It was not possible to independently verify the information from either side.
Earlier, the non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch had said hundreds of civilians were sheltering in the theatre.
