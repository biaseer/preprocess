In a lengthy televised address, Putin said eastern Ukraine was ancient Russian lands and that he was confident that the Russian people would support his decision.
He said that Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood and complained that post-Soviet Ukraine had wanted everything it could from Moscow without doing anything in return.
President Putin, in recognising the two breakaway republics in Ukraines Donbass region claimed that Ukraine historically belongs to Russia.
Echoing President Vladimir Putin, Russias foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday questioned whether Ukraine had a right to sovereignty.
If we talk about the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, one of the key documents  is the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations among Peoples, he told the Interfax news agency.
I dont think anyone can claim that the Ukrainian regime, since the 2014 coup dtat, represents all the people living on the territory of the Ukrainian state, Lavrov said.
In a comment that will stir outrage in Kyiv, Lavrov said the Ukrainian government does not represent the countrys constituent parts.
He accused Ukraine of being out of line with that since 2014 when a Moscow-backed president was overthrown in Kyiv and replaced by a pro-Western leader, prompting Russia to annex Ukraines peninsula of Crimea and back an insurgency in its eastern regions.
