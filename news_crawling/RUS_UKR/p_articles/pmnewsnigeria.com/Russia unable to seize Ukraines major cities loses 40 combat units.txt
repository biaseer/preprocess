So far, reports Reuters, Moscow has not captured any of Ukraines 10 biggest cities following its incursion that began on Feb. 24, the largest assault on a European state since 1945.
Ukrainian authorities said some 20,000 people from Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, managed to get to safety on Tuesday.
In the Odessa region, Russian ships were shelling the Ukrainian coast but there was no attempt to land, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said.
Zelensky said demands are starting to get more realistic, while warning it would still take a while before Ukraine can be satisfied with talks.
The Russian army was attempting a blockade of the city from the western and eastern fringes of the port city, but was suffering significant losses, according to the bulletin.
Meanwhile the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia assured Zelensky of their solidarity and support during a visit to Kiev.
