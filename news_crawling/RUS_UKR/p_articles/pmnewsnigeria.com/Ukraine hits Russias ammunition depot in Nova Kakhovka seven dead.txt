The information was confirmed by the adviser to the head of the Kherson regional military administration Serhiy Khlan.
Ukraine says Russian forces have targeted civilians since they invaded on Feb. 24, leaving cities, towns and villages in ruins, but Moscow rejects the charge and in turn says Ukrainians are responsible for civilians deaths.
Serhiy Bratchuk, Odesa administration spokesperson, wrote on his Telegram channel that Nova Kakhovka was now minus its ammunition warehouse.
There are still many people under the rubble. The injured are being taken to the hospital, but many people are blocked in their apartments and houses, Leontyev added.
Russian TASS news agency also confirmed the strike and said at least seven people were killed. The agency did not say whether an ammunition depot was hit.

There are already seven dead for sure and about 60 wounded, TASS quoted Vladimir Leontyev, head of Russia-installed Kakhovka District military-civilian administration in the Kherson region.
Ukrainian officials said their forces had destroyed an ammunition depot in Nova Kakhovka, in Russian-occupied Kherson region.
Peoples windows are flying out, but they are still happy Because this means that the Armed Forces of Ukraine is close, he wrote on Facebook.
Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 claiming it was a special military operation to demilitarise its neighbour and rid it of dangerous nationalists. Kyiv and the West say it was an imperialist land grab by Putin.
