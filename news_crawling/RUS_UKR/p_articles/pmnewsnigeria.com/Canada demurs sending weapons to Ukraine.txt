The government will do this by extending Operation Unifier for an additional three years and boosting both intelligence sharing and support to combat Russian cyber attacks.
The Canadian government will not send small weapons to assist Ukraine in defending its territory against the threat of Russian aggression.
It was the decision of a three-day virtual cabinet retreat where the proposal on whether to send arms was discussed.
Canadas position comes as several Western nations fear a Russian military invasion of the former Soviet state is becoming possible.
