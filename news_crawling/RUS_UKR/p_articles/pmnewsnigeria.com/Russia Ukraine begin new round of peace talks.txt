Since Feb. 28, Russia and Ukraine have held three rounds of face-to-face peace talks and a series of online discussions, failing to reach a major agreement.
Before the meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the time had come for talks to yield concrete results.
Russia and Ukraine kicked off a fresh round of face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday in yet another attempt to reach a ceasefire in the ongoing war between the two countries.
The world is waiting for good news from you. We are ready for any contribution that can make your job easier, Erdogan said.
He added that Turkey was ready to host a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
The Turkish leader who called for an immediate ceasefire said a prolonged conflict was not in anyones interest.
