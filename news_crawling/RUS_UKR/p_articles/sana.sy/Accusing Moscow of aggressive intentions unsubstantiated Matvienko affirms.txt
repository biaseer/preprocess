He said If our partners finally listen to our concerns, the process of de-escalation will take place quickly and that will be in the interest of all the peoples of Europe and the world.
Moscow, SANA- There are no objective grounds for accusing Russia of hiding aggressive intentions, Speaker of the Federation Council of Russia Valentina Matvienko stressed, noting that the subject of the alleged invasion of Ukraine is not substantiated.
For his part, Russias permanent representative to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, denied rumors and allegations about a Russian invasion of Ukraine in the coming days.
When the West directs serious accusations against Russia It must provide evidence, otherwise these accusations are false Also, Western countries must take a serious stance on the vital security issues that Moscow refers to, Chizhov said in interview with German Welt T.V. channel.
