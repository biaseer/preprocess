Simultaneously, Ukrainian representatives initiated dialogue with foreign companies on providing assistance to Ukraine in creating its own uranium enrichment facilities on the countrys territory, the source said.
In the context of heightened tensions with Russia, the Ukrainian leadership decided to destroy all valuable documents stored in scientific centers in Kyiv and Kharkiv or transfer them to Lviv Polytechnic National University in order to avoid accusations against the Kyiv regime over the presence of a weapons component in the nuclear program of Ukraine. Sputnik Agency quoted the source as saying.
The source pointed out that the Ukrainian authorities made the Chernobyl nuclear power plant a center for building a plutonium-based dirty bomb nuclear weapon.
Moscow, SANA- A Russian government source revealed today that Ukraine destroyed the bulk of documents related to the production of nuclear weapons in the capital, Kyiv, and the city of Kharkiv, and transferred some of them to Lviv.
Due to this, it is remarkable that at the Zheltye Vody hydrometallurgical plant, the processing of the concentrate of uranium oxide from the ore quarried in Ukraine is already underway which can be used in the uranium enrichment process in gas centrifuges without additional processing or purification, the source added.
He stressed that in recent years, the Ukrainian authorities have increased the geologic exploration of deep layers in the vicinity of operating uranium mines as well as the development of prospective uranium deposits, particularly, in the Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk and Kirovograd regions.
