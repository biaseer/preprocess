Moocow, SANA- Russian Foreign Ministry has strongly slammed the statements of some Austrian officials about the developments of situation in Ukraine and the Russian special military operation to protect people of Donbas, stressing that these statements are not commensurate with Austrias neutral status
We condemn in the strongest terms these false allegations and assessments, and deeply regret that they were made by Austrian officials, since they put Austrias neutral stance into question, the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Ministry stressed that these Austrian stances will be taken into consideration later, including the statements of Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and European and Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Schallenberg
