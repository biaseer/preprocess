Moscow, SANA- Chief of Russias National Defense Management Center, Mikhail Mezentsev, has announced that the Nazi battalions in Ukraine are planning to blow up the Kaidatsky bridge in the city of Dnipropetrovsk after the Russian forces approached it.
Mezentsev added that that Russian forces do not target civilian infrastructure and they treat civilians humanely.
He also indicated that the explosion led to the appearance of a cloud of orange smoke that dissipated after a while, explaining that there were no casualties among the Russian military and residents as a result of this provocation.
He affirmed that the Ukrainian forces and their Nazi formations blew up a tank loaded with fertilizers and probably ammonium nitrate in Dolzhenkoy district of Kharkov province on Wednesday to accuse the Russian forces of using chemical weapons.
We have reliably made sure that this bridge is mined, and if the Russian units and the forces of the Donetsk Peoples Republic approach, it will be detonated, as the Ukrainian side plans to accuse the Russian forces of launching indiscriminate strikes on vital infrastructure facilities, Mezentsev said in a media briefing Thursday.
