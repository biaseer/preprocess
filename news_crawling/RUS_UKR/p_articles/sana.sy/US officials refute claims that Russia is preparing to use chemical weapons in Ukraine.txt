Many US officials emphasized that the US used information as a weapon even when confidence in the accuracy of the information was not high, and at times it used low confidence intelligence in order to achieve a deterrent effect, as is the case with chemical weapons.
Washington, SANA- The US NBC News Network has revealed that US officials have denied leaked inaccurate intelligence information that is not based on reliable evidence about Russias readiness to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, pointing out that what the Western media is circulating is part of an information war waged against Moscow.
The network stated that the Biden administration began releasing a huge amount of intelligence about what it claimed were Putins plans and intentions even before the start of the Ukraine crisis.
When the US media cited US intelligence to warn that Russia was preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, and when President Joe Biden repeated these warnings, they were participating in a disinformation campaign, the report revealed.
The report indicated that the latest information is one of a series of examples in which the Biden administration used declassified intelligence as part of the information war against Russia.
US officials, quoted by NBC, said, The Biden administration used such unreliable information to keep Russian President Vladimir Putin in an unbalanced position.
In order to win an info war against Russia, US intelligence officials have leaked misleading information about Ukraine, according to an NBC report which indicated that the officials admitted to, and boasted about, releasing this misinformation.
The networks report stated that US officials, who declined to be identified, acknowledged that there was no evidence that Russia was preparing to use any chemical weapons or that it had brought such weapons to Ukraines borders.
A Western government official familiar with the strategy pointed out that the idea is to pre-empt and disrupt the Kremlins tactics, complicate its military campaign and prevent Russia from determining how the world views the war.
