The White Helmets are a tool used by the West to carry out provocations with chemical weapons, as well as to use human rights issues for the purposes and interests of the party dealing with it  I have no doubt that we are talking about the active participation of this pseudo-inhumane organization in Ukraine, Zakharova told reporters today in Moscow.
She added that In addition, the provocations of the White Helmets can be used in Ukraine to divert attention from the Western biological laboratories discovered in the country.
She noted that it is wrong to consider such statements as an individual and independent opinion.
In addition, Zakharova stressed that the statements about the alleged Russian threat to Sweden and Finland are propaganda and provocation that serve the interests of the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO.
Commenting on the statements of Swedish Foreign Minister Anne Lind about not accepting Russias threat to Sweden and Finland in any way, Zakharova said, These statements are unintelligent, not based on facts, in line with propaganda and provocation, and do not meet the interests of the peoples of these countries and guarantee and serve the interests of NATO.
Members of the White Helmets are already participating in hostilities in Ukraine because they are firstly, a team that has experienced in Syria and is known in the Western media and has passed the so-called verification. This is a very important point And after all their funding has not stopped, she said.
Moscow, SANA- Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has affirmed that the active participation of members of the White Helmets organization in organizing provocations in Ukraine has become well known.
