The forces of the Lugansk Peoples Republic and the Russian support forces announced yesterday the start of the cleaning operation of the nitrogen plant in Severodonetsk.
Grozny, SANA- President of the Russian Republic of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov has announced that the Russian forces had liberated 800 civilians, including children, who were being used as human shields by the Ukrainian armed extremist formations at the Azot plant in Severodonetsk, Belogansk.
He added that the Russian forces were providing them with a green corridor through which they could obtain assistance, food, medicine and a quiet life only a hundred meters from the plant.
It can be said without exaggeration that these civilians were released from Ukrainian captivity, Kadyrov said in a post on his account on the Telegram channel.
Kadyrov wondered what those fascists who kept civilians as human shields can be called, as what they did proves the falseness of Nazi propaganda.
