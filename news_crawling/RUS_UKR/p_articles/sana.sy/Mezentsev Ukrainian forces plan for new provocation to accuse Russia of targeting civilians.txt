Moscow, SANA- Chief of Russias National Defense Management Center, Mikhail Mezentsev, announced that the Ukrainian regime is planning for a new provocation in the western regions of Ukraine to accuse the Russian armed forces of targeting civilians.
On May 8th, the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, which Ukraine celebrates as an alternative to Victory Day marking the victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, the Kyiv regime is planning for complex provocations that would lead to deaths among civilians, with the aim of holding the Russian armed forces responsible for alleged indiscriminate missile strikes, TASS news agency quoted Mezentsev as saying on Saturday.
He added that these fake attacks which are being prepared by the Ukrainian authorities with the approval of those who deal with them from Western countries show Kyivs complete indifference to its citizens.
