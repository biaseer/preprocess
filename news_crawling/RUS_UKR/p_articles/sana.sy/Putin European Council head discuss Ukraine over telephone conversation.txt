Putin criticized the irresponsible statements by European Union representatives regarding the necessity to resolve the situation in Ukraine militarily, and their disregard for numerous war crimes by Ukrainian forces.
Putin said that It was noted that after the liberation of Mariupol orders were issued, for humanitarian reasons, to cancel the assault on the industrial zone of the Azovstal plant.
Moscow, SANA- Russian President Vladimir Putin and European Council President Charles Michel had a telephone conversation on Friday during which they discussed measures taken by Russia to protect civilians as part of its military operation in Ukraine, especially in the city of Mariupol
Putin noted that If they lay down their arms, all Ukrainian army servicemen, militants of the nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries are guaranteed to keep their lives, receive decent treatment in accordance with international law and have proper medical assistance.
Putin stressed that Brussels could influence Kyiv authorities to make them stop the massive shelling of residential areas in Donbass and other grave violations of international humanitarian law.
In response to a call by Michel to hold a direct contact between the Russian President and his Ukrainian counterpart, Vladimir Zelensky, the Russian President indicated that this possibility depends on on achieving tangible results of the ongoing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine where the Ukrainian side is showing inconsistency and isnt willing to look for mutually acceptable solutions.
