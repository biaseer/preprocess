"This is a barbaric invasion of a sovereign nation and it is important that we show that we are in total solidarity with Ukraine.
The country has been under attack by Vladimir Putin's regime since last Thursday, with columns of Russian armour currently en route to the capital kyiv.
Halton Residents and motorists have seen the huge structure bathed in blue and yellow for the last few days as a mark of solidarity with Ukraine.
We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues. The ability to comment on our stories is a privilege, not a right, however, and that privilege may be withdrawn if it is abused or misused.
Councils and other organisations up and down the country and acrossthe region have also taken steps to show support to the Ukrainianpeople.
Chester Eastgate Clock and Town Hall has been light up blue and yellow, as has Liverpool's St George's Hall.
Cllr Mike Wharton, leader of Halton Borough Council, said: The bridge is lit in support of the Ukrainianpeople to show that Halton is totally opposed to the Russian aggression and invasion of their country.
"We are absolutely appalled at the disgraceful act of Putin and the attack on democracy. It is an outrageous assault on innocent people and indeed our way of life.
THE Mersey Gateway will remain lit in the colours of Ukraine's national flag until Thursday, as Halton's leader hit out at what he called the 'barbaric invasion' of the country.
