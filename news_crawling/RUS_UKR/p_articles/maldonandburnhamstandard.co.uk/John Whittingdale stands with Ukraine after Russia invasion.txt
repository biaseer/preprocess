"Today we must all stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and give as much assistance to them as we can, while also making sure that Russia pays a high price for its aggression."
Talks between Ukraine and Russia began today, the foreign ministries of both countries confirmed, after four days of fighting since Russia crossed the border into its neighbouring country.
Maldon MP John Whittingdale, who was the chair of the British Ukraine All Party Parliamentary group from 2010 to 2020, has slammed the invasion and says it is a serious threat to world peace.

Mr Whittingdale recognised the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war globally in terms of energy costs, a surge of refugees and "the damage to world order and international law".
He said: "Russias invasion of Ukraine is completely unprovoked, a flagrant breach of international law and the most serious threat to world peace since the second world war.
THE Maldon MP is urging his constituents to stand in solidarity with Ukraine after Russia launched a full-scale invasion.
Mr Whittingdale led the UK Delegation to the meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Vienna last week.
However, he added: "These are small compared to the agonies of the innocent people of Ukraine and it is them who we must do all we can to support."
He says he was proud to stand alongside the head of the Ukrainian Delegation, Nikita Poturaiev, andrefuted the justification of Russias actions by their own delegation.
