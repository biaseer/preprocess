Meanwhile, in the first war crimes trial held by Ukraine, a captured Russian soldier testified Thursday that he shot an unarmed Ukrainian civilian in the head on his officers orders.
KYIV, Ukraine AP  Russia says hundreds more fighters have emerged from the Mariupol stronghold where they made their last stand and surrendered.
A monthslong siege of Mariupol that left it in ruins and the drama of last-ditch fighters at a steel plant holding off Russian forces turned the strategic port city into a worldwide symbol of suffering and defiance.
The Red Cross is working to register the fighters as prisoners of war, as the end of a key battle in the conflict draws closer.
