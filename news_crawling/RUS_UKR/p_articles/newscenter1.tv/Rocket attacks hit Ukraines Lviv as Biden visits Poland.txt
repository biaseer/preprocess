LVIV, Ukraine AP  Russian rockets struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv while President Joe Biden visited neighboring Poland.
The airstrikes shook a city seen as a haven in Ukraine for hundreds of thousands of displaced people and prompted some to pack up once again.
The attacks Saturday were a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite its claim to be focusing its offensive on the countrys east.
Lviv also has become a humanitarian staging ground for Ukraine, and the attacks could further complicate that work.
