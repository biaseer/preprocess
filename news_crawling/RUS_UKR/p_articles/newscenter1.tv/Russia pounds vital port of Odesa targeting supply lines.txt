Ukraines ability to stymie a larger, better armed Russian military surprised many observers, who had anticipated a much quicker conflict.
ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine AP  Ukrainian officials say Russian troops are pounding away at the vital port of Odesa, apparently as part of efforts to disrupt the supply lines and weapons shipments that have been critical to Kyivs defense.
With the war now in its 11th week and Kyiv bogging Russian forces down in many places and even staging a counteroffensive in others, Ukraines foreign minister appeared to voice confidence that the country could expand its aims beyond merely pushing Russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of Feb. 24 invasion.
