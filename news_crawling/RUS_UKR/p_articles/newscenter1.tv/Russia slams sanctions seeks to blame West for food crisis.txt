Ukraine is one of the worlds largest exporters of wheat, corn and sunflower oil. The war, including a Russian blockade of its ports, has prevented much of that flow.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tried to put the blame for the crisis squarely on Western sanctions.
KYIV, Ukraine AP  Russia is pressing the West to lift sanctions over the war in Ukraine, seeking to shift the blame for a growing food crisis.
Britain accused Moscow of trying to hold the world ransom and insisted there would be no sanctions relief.
That crisis is worsened by Kyivs inability to ship millions of tons of grain and other agricultural products because of the conflict.
