Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the move would not bring stability to Europe. Nato was formed in 1949 to counter the threat of Soviet expansion and domination, and since the fall of the Berlin wall a number of formerly communist eastern European countries have joined the military alliance.Member states agree to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Back in February Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, warned of "military and political consequences" if the countries joined the bloc.And on Monday, April 11, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that "the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation" and thst Moscow is clear when it comes to opposing any potential enlargement of the alliance.Peskov warned the bloc "is not that kind of alliance which ensures peace and stability, and its further expansion will not bring additional security to the European continent".The warning by Russia comesas US defence officials expect Sweden and Finland to bid for membership of the alliance, potentially as early as June saying Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has been a "massive strategic blunder" which is likely to bring Nato enlargement.The move would see the Western alliance grow to 32 members and US State Department officials said last week that discussions had taken place between Nato leaders and foreign ministers from Helsinki and Stockholm.Before Russia invades Ukraine, Russia demanded that the alliance agree to halt any future enlargement, but the war has led to the deployment of more Nato troops on its eastern flank and a rise in public support for Swedish and Finnish membership.Finnish lawmakers are expected to receive a security report from intelligence officials this week, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said she expects her government "will end the discussion before midsummer" on whether to make a membership application.Finland shares a 1,340km 830 miles long border with Russia and has been angered by the invasion of Ukraine.While Sweden's ruling Social Democratic party, which has traditionally opposed Nato membership, said it is rethinking this position in light of Russia's attack on its western neighbour. Party secretary Tobias Baudin told local media that the Nato review should be complete within the next few months."When Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden's security position changed fundamentally," the party said in a statement on Monday.Also both countries stepped up defence spending since the invasion of Ukraine.On Monday, army leaders in Helsinki announced a new plan to allocate 14m 10.88m to purchase drones for Finland's military.And last month Swedish officials said they would boost defence spending by three billion kronas $317m 243m in 2022.
