Rev Dr Worlanyo Mensah, achartered economisthas said theCOVID-19 pandemicand the Russia-Ukraine war brought more blessings to Ghana than challenges.Talking onThe Asaase Breakfast Showon Wednesday 15 June, Mensah said Ghanas economic woes are mainly due to mismanagement.Definitely this also beats my imagination when even the president sometimes talk about our woes, our challenges based on theRussia-Ukraine warand the issue ofCOVID-19, he said.I think the issue of COVID-19 and theRussia-Ukraine waris more of a blessing than a curse to our economy. Look at the number of funds that came in to help cushion us, Mensah said.You realise that when COVID-19 came, the quantum of resources that we received to support our economy has been so gargantuan, and so as at now as a country we failed to even account for these funds. So, I believe that we could have turned this economy around if we had really made judicious use of these funds.According to him, the government is now generating more revenue from crude oil due to the Ukraine crisis. .Now, if you consider the Russia-Ukraine war, the biggest effect of the war is that it has increased international fuel price, and now Ghana is also an exporter of crude oil.So, that means that we are making extraordinary profit from crude oil than before, and so the Russia- Ukraine war has brought a much more blessing to the state Our problem now is purely mismanagement. I dont think we have any tragedy at hand.The time is now for this continent to stand on a sound footing. It all depends on the financial structures that we will put in place for the future, which is now, Mensah added.
