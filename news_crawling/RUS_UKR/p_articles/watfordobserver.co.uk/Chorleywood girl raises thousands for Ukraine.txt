She said: My mum is Ukrainian and her family live in Hostomel near Kyiv. A lot of the town has been destroyed and is still under constant attack.
She added: Those who do are being killed or captured. There is no mobile communication, no internet, no gas, no electricity, no running water and food is increasingly scarce.
Her mother, Tanya, said: Anna has been amazing. Were raising money to do our bit and help people who are suffering over in Ukraine. Anna is fully aware that there is a war going on and she wanted to be able to do something to help.
The war hits close to home for Anna Kirk, from Chorleywood, as her mother is Ukrainian and her family members suffer from the turmoil.
It took Anna around two hours to finish the 10k run. She had done a lot of running in the week build-up as training which helped her."

Miss Kirk has been training her stamina while attending swimming lessons at William Penn Leisure Centre.
The charitable child said her aunt cannot escape Ukraine as the Russian army are not allowing people to leave their homes.
Some of my cousins were able to leave the town and move their young children to safer places near the Ukrainian borders, but my auntie stayed and is hiding and can no longer leave home.
To do her bit, she raised 5,000 for Action Aid by running 10km through Chorleywood Common last weekend to supply people with water, food, protection and trauma care.
