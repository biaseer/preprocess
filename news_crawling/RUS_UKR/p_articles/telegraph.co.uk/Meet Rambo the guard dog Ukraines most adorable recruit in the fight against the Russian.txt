The relationship between Rambo and the men is clearly not just a one-way street. The black puppy with a white striped belly benefits from food and warmth, while the men seem to relish the companionship in times of immense strain.
We felt sorry for him, it was freezing outside. We took him into our post and he stayed with us.
Now part of their unit, the soldiers have christened him 'Rambo' and stationed him as their guard dog.
It is a job the tiny puppy is well suited for, with his superior hearing and sense of smell.

Everyone in Ukraine feels it is their duty to stand up against the Russian forces and Rambo is no different. He is security, thats his job. He is our watchdog, adds another soldier.
He used to be so tiny he could fit in one hand, the soldiers say.
Ukrainian soldiers guarding a post in Donbas have a recruited an adorable puppy to stand as guard dog after spotting him freezing and alone.
In a heart-warming clip from the Albanian Times, the soldiers explain how they spotted the cute dog and took him under their wing.
