Defence analysts dissecting a downed Russian drone from the battlefield in Ukraine found a western-made consumer SLR camera inside, which the experts said had likely been smuggled into Russia from the west.
The US and European nations had already limited the sale of computer chips to Russia in the wake of its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Previous studies into Russias military modernisation showed the Kremlin relied on western electronics to bring their force into the 21st century.
During a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Ms Raimondo also claimed two Russian tank factories have been forced to shut down because of a lack of components.
Almost 30 western nations have adopted similar punitive measures against Moscow, making it virtually impossible for the Kremlins armed forces to secure the required components to fix their battle-weakened military machines.
Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said: We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground, its filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators.
Technology experts have estimated exports to Russia have slumped by nearly 70 per cent since the introduction of sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine on February 24.
Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, the west has further tightened its rules for so-called dual-use products, with military and commercial applications, being shipped to Russia.
Russia has been forced to use computer chips from dishwashers and refrigerators in their military hardware as a result of western sanctions, a top US official has said.
