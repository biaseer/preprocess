In the clip, which was taken in service with Ukraines 47th Motorised Infantry Battalion, the drone is seen dropping explosives on several Russian soldiers who appear to be eviscerated, with body parts scattered across the battlefield.
During an address, Mr Putin compared himself to Peter the Great, the Russian monarch who captured swathes of territory in Sweden.
The images in the video are accompanied by an ominous, electronic soundtrack and the video itself is bathed in reds and purples as it shows the attack from the drone's night vision perspective.
The footage was shared online by Ukrainian Twitter user SegaRep, who wrote in the caption: "The Ukrainian UAV with night vision and the ability to drop bombs works great on Russian invaders in the trenches. You can't hide from us."
Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, appeared to admit last week that he had invaded Ukraine as part of an imperial conquest, rather than due to security concerns over Nato.

Video footage has captured the moment Ukrainian forces used a night vision-equipped drone to kill Russian soldiers in a trench.
The video may have been filmed in eastern Ukraine where some of the most intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops is underway.
It is unclear what type of drone is being used in the footage. However, the Turkish-made Bayraktar drone has been hailed by Ukrainian forces as one of their most effective weapons in the battle against Russian invaders.
Ukraine says as many as a hundred soldiers on its side of the war are dying every day as they repel Russia's invasion.
