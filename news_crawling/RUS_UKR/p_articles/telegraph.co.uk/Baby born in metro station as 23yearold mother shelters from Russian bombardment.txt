Mia was born just before 8.30pm on Friday after others in the station heard her mothers screams and rushed to help deliver her.
Mykhailo Podolyak, President Volodymyr Zelensky's adviser, said Russia wanted to seize control of the capital and destroy the country's leadership. However, the Russian military has failed to make any gains and that the Ukrainian forces control the situation in Kyiv, he added.
The boy was delivered in the basement of a hospital after parts of the building were damaged by an attack.
A doctor said: In conditions, far from those who deserve a new life - the voice of the newborn ... it's a boy!
An ambulance was later called to take them to hospital. Both mother and baby are said to be doing well.
The UN refugee agency said that more than 120,000 Ukrainian refugees have left the country since Russia began its attack.
"When Putin kills Ukrainians, we call mothers of Russia and Belarus to protest against Russia war in Ukraine. We defend lives and humanity, added Ms Hopko, who chairs the Democracy in Action Conference.
A 23-year-old woman has given birth to a baby girl in a Kyiv metro station while sheltering from Russianbombs in what has been called a "beacon of hope".
Witness Hannah Hopko said Mia was born in a stressful environment amid heavy bombing, but that the mother is happy after this challenging birth.
Kyiv suffered its worst night of bombing in decades after Russian troops engaged in battle with Ukrainian forces in the capital on Saturday. The troops were trying to advance on the city from several directions.
