James, 47, left Connecticut earlier this month to fight alongside Ukrainian forces on the front lines and regularly updates his Twitter followers with the situation on the ground.
Since Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, called for international help to help combat the Russian invasion, volunteers from across the world have travelled to join the international legion of fighters supporting Ukraine's armed forces.
In a video update outlining his military equipment, Mr Vasquez shows the weapons he has supplied himself and calls on other countries to provide more in "a plea for help".
James Vasquez, a US army veteran, has appealed to nations around the world to continue sending weapons to Ukraine to support its fight against Russia.
