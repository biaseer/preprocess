Three smoke trails indicate air defence missiles have already been fired at an unknown object.
Dramatic footage on social media appears to show the moment a Russian air defence missile malfunctioned and flew back to its launch site, resulting in a massive explosion.
In this instance, the large explosion was probably caused by unspent fuel in the rocket.
It is not known what caused the missile to malfunction and return to its launch point or if there were any casualties from the incident.
A fourth missile is then fired. At around 300ft above the ground the rocket suddenly turns and dives towards the ground, seemingly returning to its launch point.
The unverified video, from the Face Of War Telegram channel, is said to show a missile launch from the town of Alchevsk, about 20km west of Luhansk in the Russian-controlled east of Ukraine.
Surface-to-air missiles do not carry large explosive warheads, relying primarily on their speed to smash into the body of jets and helicopters, igniting the aircrafts fuel or otherwise causing them to be so unstable, as chunks of the aircraft are ripped away, that they crash.
Initial reports said an engine fire caused the crash, which killed four of the nine crew on board.

In a separate incident, a Russian Il-76 transport plane on a flight to supply Vladimir Putins war effort exploded into flames mid-air before crashing shortly after take-off from the city of Ryazan, near Moscow.
