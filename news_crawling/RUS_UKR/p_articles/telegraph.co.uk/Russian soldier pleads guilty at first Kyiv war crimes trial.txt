The youthful-looking soldier with a shaved head looked towards the ground as a prosecutor read out charges against him in Ukrainian.
Prosecutors say Shishimarin was commanding a unit in a tank division when his convoy came under attack.
Shishimarin - from the Siberian region of Irkutsk - sat in the glass defendant's box in a Kyiv district court, wearing a blue and grey hoodie.
Asked in court if he was guilty of the allegations, including war crimes and premeditated murder, 21-year-old sergeant Vadim Shishimarin responded "yes".
The first Russian soldier on trial in Ukraine for war crimes during Moscow's invasion pleaded guilty on Wednesday, facing possible life imprisonment in Kyiv.
He is accused of killing a 62-year-old civilian in northeast Ukraine in the first days of the Kremlin's offensive.
According to prosecutors, Shishimarin was ordered to kill the civilian and used a Kalashnikov assault rifle to do so.

He is accused of killing the civilian - allegedly on a bicycle - near the village of Chupakhivka in the eastern Sumy region on February 28.
He and four other soldiers stole a car, and as they travelled near Chupakhivka they encountered a 62-year-old man on a bicycle, they said.
