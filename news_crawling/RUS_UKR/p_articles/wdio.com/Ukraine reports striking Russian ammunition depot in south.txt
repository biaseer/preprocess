KYIV, Ukraine AP  Ukraines military has reported destroying a Russian ammunition depot in southern Ukraine.
Late Tuesday, explosions were reported in Luhansk, a city in the Donbas that has been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014.
The Ukrainian militarys southern command said a rocket strike targeted the depot in Russian-held Nova Kakhovka. Thats about 35 miles 55 kilometers east of the Black Sea port city of Kherson, which is also occupied by Russian forces.
Ukraine indicated in recent days that it might launch a counteroffensive to reclaim territory in the countrys south as Russia bombards the eastern Donbas region.
The nature of the strike suggested Ukrainian forces used U.S-supplied multiple-launch High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS.
