KYIV, Ukraine  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shed more light on his talks with Russia in an exclusive interview with CNN and Reuters.
The leader said he is still unsure whether talks with Russia are a waste of time.
"If you do this, and that side is ready, it means they are ready for peace. If they are not ready, it means that you are just, you know, just wasting time, Zelenskyy said.
Officials from the two countries spoke Monday for the first time since the invasion started.
They decided to begin to speak about this situation, Zelenskyy said, in reference to Russia.
And do you think youre wasting your time, or do you think theyre ready? CNN asked.
You have to speak first of all. Everybody has to stop fighting and to go back to that point from where it began five, six, todays six, six days ago, he said.
The president said as long as violence continues in Ukraine, it will be difficult to make progress with talks.
