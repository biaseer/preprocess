The context for what is happening in Ukraine is a sustained Russian campaign of disinformation against its neighbors: not just Ukraine but also the Baltic States  Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia  and Georgia for more than a decade.
The outlet headlined deep fakes, such as the poorly-constructed deception of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy surrendering, and an imposters phone call to UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace.
The deep-fake video was a crude effort which was easy to dismiss. Whats more interesting is Russian disinformation which made it into the top of your program.
But I noted the contest against more pernicious Russian disinformation: in the introduction to our interview, the anchor cited  without noting the lie  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovs falsehood of 300 US biological research labs pursuing biological warfare.
The discussion considers the vital role of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, efforts to counter Russian disinformation, and Moscows self-imposed hurdles with the commission of war crimes.
I joined Indias WION News on Friday to discuss the information battle in Russias invasion of Ukraine.
ORIGINAL ENTRY: EAs David Dunn and Victoria Vyshnivska of Ukraines Independent Anti-Corruption Commission joined Monocle 24s Georgina Godwin on Thursday to discuss the information battlefront in Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine.
The brutal answer is that Russia doesnt care about its war crimes. Russias priority in this war is to break the will of Ukrainians, and by killing women and children and attacking hospitals they hope to break the spirit of their enemy.
UK defence secretary Ben Wallace receives a hoax call from a man pretending to be Ukraine PM Denys Shmyhal. Wallace has blamed Russia for the fake call.
