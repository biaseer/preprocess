Whether that government comes from within the Conservative Party, whether it comes from an opposition party that steps forward, or whether  perhaps best of all  it comes from MPs of all parties and saying that we need responsibility from all sides of the House rather than more spectacle and clownishness.
We evaluate the shadow whipping operation of some Conservative MPs propping up Johnson, even as others called out his deception and dishonesty over the revelations. We note the latest distraction: sending Johnson to Eastern Europe this week with the claim that you cannot replace a leader  no matter how irresponsible or incompetent  during the Russian threat of war on Ukraine.
The answer is a responsible government. The answer is a competent Prime Minister who does not deceive the nation, who does not mislead, especially over the pandemic, especially when so many have lost so much.
And we explain Scotland Yards role in attempted salvation of Johnson, delaying and threatening to gut the investigative report of top civil servant Sue Gray about Partygate.
