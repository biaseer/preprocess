Ukraine is returning its own. It will return the Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea.This will happen.
Because the Russians have had to pull resources from the east simply because of reports that the Ukrainians might be going more on the offense in the south. And so theyve had to deplete certain units in certain areas in the East in the Donbass, to respond to what they clearly believed was a looming threat of a counter offensive.
Ukraine Presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak reports that Russias forces are obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency mission trying to reach the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine.
The video of the meeting was released as Ukraines counter-offensive advanced into the liberated territories, with reports of support from residents and attacks on Russian proxy officials by Ukrainian partisans.
The operation began at night with massive shelling of Russian positions and the rear. The main direction of the attack was on Pravdyne. We hit their infantry from the DNR and LNR the Russian proxies Donetsk Peoples Republic and Luhansk Peoples Republic, and they fled. The Russian landing force fled after them.
