It is at that point that you will need to see the international community support the Ukrainians as they resist Russian occupation.
Three hours before Vladimir Putin launched Russias war on Ukraine, analyst Molly McKew and I joined BBC 5 Lives Colin Murray for a 25-minute analysis of the imminent bombing and invasion.
The immediate question is, Do the Russians just move into the areas controlled by their proxies  about 13 of Donetsk and Luhansk  or do they go further?
We assess the motives for Putins gamble on a war and consider the response by the US, Europe, and the international community.
The international response will not be enough to prevent Russia from putting its heel on the Ukrainian people. But this is not a case of weeks or months, because there will be a Ukrainian insurgency.
I dont think Putin is a master strategist. Hes a good tactician, but hes a poor strategist. When you look beyond the immediate headlines about the Russian occupation of Ukraine, he could wind up breaking his country.
If they go further and invade the area controlled by Ukraine forces, we have a war on our hands.
It wont stop here. The Russians will take the east of Ukraine and then they will try to overthrow and undermine Kyiv and install their man in the capital.
